Development History Usage Repository structure Code auto-formatting Linting Pre-commit hook Testing Running tests Why is a test failing? assert_pdf_equal & writing new tests GitHub pipeline Release checklist Documentation PDF spec & new features History This project, fpdf2 is a fork of the PyFPDF project, which can be found on GitHub at reingart/pyfpdf . Its aim is to keep the library up to date, to fulfill the goals of its original roadmap and provide a general overhaul of the codebase to address technical debt keeping features from being added and bugs to be eradicated. More on PyFPDF : This project started as Python fork of the FPDF PHP library. Later, code for native reading TTF fonts was added. FPDF has not been updated since 2011. See also the TCPDF library. Until 2015 the code was developed at Google Code . Now the main repository is at Github . You can also view the old repository , old issues , and old wiki .

This \"uncomprimising Python code formatter\" must be installed in your development environment ( pip install black ) in order to auto-format source code before any commit. Linting We use pylint as a static code analyzer to detect potential issues in the code. In case of special \"false positive\" cases, checks can be disabled locally with #pylint disable=XXX code comments, or globally through the .pylintrc file. Pre-commit hook If you use a UNIX system, you can place the following shell code in .git/hooks/pre-commit in order to always invoke black & pylint before every commit: #!/bin/bash git_cached_names () { git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter = ACM ; } if grep -IRF generate = True $( git_cached_names | grep 'test.*\\.py$' ) ; then echo '`generate=True` left remaining in a call to assert_pdf_equal' exit 1 fi modified_py_files = $( git_cached_names | grep '\\.py$' ) modified_fpdf_files = $( git_cached_names | grep '^fpdf.*\\.py$' ) # If any Python files were modified, format them: if [ -n \" $modified_py_files \" ] ; then if ! black --check $modified_py_files ; then black $modified_py_files exit 1 fi # If fpdf/ files were modified, lint them: [[ $modified_fpdf_files == \"\" ]] || pylint $modified_fpdf_files fi It will abort the commit if pylint found issues or black detect non-properly formatted code. In the later case though, it will auto-format your code and you will just have to run git commit -a again. Testing Running tests To run tests, cd into fpdf2 repository, install the dependencies using pip install -r test/requirements.txt , and run pytest . You can run a single test by executing: pytest -k function_name . Alternatively, you can use Tox . It is self-documented in the tox.ini file in the repository. To run tests for all versions of Python, simply run tox . If you do not want to run tests for all versions of python, run tox -e py39 (or your version of Python). Why is a test failing? If there are some failing tests after you made a code change, it is usually because there are difference between an expected PDF generated and the actual one produced . Calling pytest -vv will display the difference of PDF source code between the expected & actual files, but that may be difficult to understand, You can also have a look at the PDF files involved by navigating to the temporary test directory that is printed out during the test failure: =================================== FAILURES =================================== ____________________________ test_html_simple_table ____________________________ tmp_path = PosixPath('/tmp/pytest-of-runner/pytest-0/test_html_simple_table0') This directory contains the actual & expected files, that you can vsualize to spot differences: $ ls /tmp/pytest-of-runner/pytest-0/test_html_simple_table0 actual.pdf actual_qpdf.pdf expected_qpdf.pdf assert_pdf_equal & writing new tests When a unit test generates a PDF, it is recommended to use the assert_pdf_equal utility function in order to validate the output. It relies on the very handy qpdf CLI program to generate a PDF that is easy to compare: annotated, strictly formatted, with uncompressed internal streams. You will need to have its binary in your $PATH , otherwise assert_pdf_equal will fall back to hash-based comparison. All generated PDF files (including those processed by qpdf ) will be stored in /tmp/pytest-of-USERNAME/pytest-current/NAME_OF_TEST/ . By default, three last test runs will be saved and then automatically deleted, so you can check the output in case of a failed test. In order to generate a \"reference\" PDF file, simply call assert_pdf_equal once with generate=True . GitHub pipeline A GitHub Actions pipeline is executed on every commit on the master branch, and for every Pull Request . It performs all validation steps detailed above: code checking with black , static code analysis with pylint , unit tests... Pull Requests submitted must pass all those checks in order to be approved. Ask maintainers through comments if some errors in the pipeline seem obscure to you. Release checklist complete CHANGELOG.md and add the version & date of the new release bump FPDF_VERSION in fpdf/fpdf.py git commit & git push check that the GitHub Actions succeed , and that a new release appears on Pypi perform a GitHub release , taking the description from the CHANGELOG.md . It will create a new git tag. Announce the release on r/pythonnews Documentation The standalone documentation is in the docs subfolder, written in Markdown . Building instructions are contained in the configuration file mkdocs.yml and also in .github/workflows/continuous-integration-workflow.yml . Additional documentation is generated from inline comments, and is available in the project home page . After being committed to the master branch, code documentation is automatically uploaded to GitHub Pages . There is a useful one-page example Python module with docstrings illustrating how to document code: pdoc3 example_pkg . To preview the Markdown documentation, launch a local rendering server with: mkdocs serve To preview the API documentation, launch a local rendering server with: pdoc --html -o public/ fpdf --http : PDF spec & new features The PDF 1.7 spec is available on Adobe website: PDF32000_2008.pdf . It may be intimidating at first, but while technical, it is usually quite clear and understandable. It is also a great place to look for new features for fpdf2 : there are still many PDF features that this library does not support.","title":"Development"},{"location":"Development.html#development","text":"This page has summary information about developing the PyPDF library.

This allows fairly low-level control over the graphics primitives that PDF provides, giving the user the ability to draw pretty much any vector shape on the page. The drawing API makes use of features (notably transparency and blending modes) that were introduced in PDF 1.4. Therefore, use of the features of this module will automatically set the output version to 1.4 (fpdf normally defaults to version 1.3. Because the PDF 1.4 specification was originally published in 2001, this version should be compatible with all viewers currently in general use). Getting Started The easiest way to add a drawing to the document is via fpdf.FPDF.new_path . This is a context manager that takes care of serializing the path to the document once the context is exited. Drawings follow the fpdf convention that the origin (that is, coordinate(0, 0)), is at the top-left corner of the page. The numbers specified to the various path commands are interpreted in the document units. import fpdf pdf = fpdf . FPDF ( unit = 'mm' , format = ( 10 , 10 )) pdf . add_page () with pdf . new_path () as path : path . move_to ( 2 , 2 ) path . line_to ( 8 , 8 ) path . horizontal_line_relative ( - 6 ) path . line_relative ( 6 , - 6 ) path . close () pdf . output ( \"drawing-demo.pdf\" ) This example draws an hourglass shape centered on the page: view as PDF Adding Some Style Drawings can be styled, changing how they look and blend with other drawings. Styling can change the color, opacity, stroke shape, and other attributes of a drawing. Let's add some color to the above example: import fpdf pdf = fpdf . FPDF ( unit = 'mm' , format = ( 10 , 10 )) pdf . add_page () with pdf . new_path () as path : path . style . fill_color = '#A070D0' path . style . stroke_color = fpdf . drawing . gray8 ( 210 ) path . style . stroke_width = 1 path . style . stroke_opacity = 0.75 path . style . stroke_join_style = 'round' path . move_to ( 2 , 2 ) path . line_to ( 8 , 8 ) path . horizontal_line_relative ( - 6 ) path . line_relative ( 6 , - 6 ) path . close () pdf . output ( \"drawing-demo.pdf\" ) If you make color choices like these, it's probably not a good idea to quit your day job to become a graphic designer. Here's what the output should look like: view as PDF Transforms And You Transforms provide the ability to manipulate the placement of points within a path without having to do any pesky math yourself. Transforms are composable using python's matrix multiplication operator ( @ ), so, for example, a transform that both rotates and scales an object can be create by matrix multiplying a rotation transform with a scaling transform. An important thing to note about transforms is that the result is order dependent, which is to say that something like performing a rotation followed by scaling will not, in the general case, result in the same output as performing the same scaling followed by the same rotation. Additionally, it's not generally possible to deconstruct a composed transformation (representing an ordered sequence of translations, scaling, rotations, shearing) back into the sequence of individual transformation functions that produced it. That's okay, because this isn't important unless you're trying to do something like animate transforms after they've been composed, which you can't do in a PDF anyway. All that said, let's take the example we've been working with for a spin (the pun is intended, you see, because we're going to rotate the drawing). Explaining the joke does make it better. An easy way to apply a transform to a path is through the path.transform property. import fpdf pdf = fpdf . FPDF ( unit = \"mm\" , format = ( 10 , 10 )) pdf . add_page () with pdf . new_path () as path : path . style . fill_color = \"#A070D0\" path . style . stroke_color = fpdf . drawing . gray8 ( 210 ) path . style . stroke_width = 1 path . style . stroke_opacity = 0.75 path . style . stroke_join_style = \"round\" path . transform = fpdf . drawing . Transform . rotation_d ( 45 ) . scale ( 0.707 ) . about ( 5 , 5 ) path . move_to ( 2 , 2 ) path . line_to ( 8 , 8 ) path . horizontal_line_relative ( - 6 ) path . line_relative ( 6 , - 6 ) path . close () pdf . output ( \"drawing-demo.pdf\" ) view as PDF The transform in the above example rotates the path 45 degrees clockwise and scales it by 1/sqrt(2) around its center point. This transform could be equivalently written as: import fpdf T = fpdf . drawing . Transform T . translation ( - 5 , - 5 ) @ T . rotation_d ( 45 ) @ T . scaling ( 0.707 ) @ T . translation ( 5 , 5 ) Because all transforms operate on points relative to the origin, if we had rotated the path without first centering it on the origin, we would have rotated it partway off of the page. Similarly, the size-reduction from the scaling would have moved it closer to the origin. By bracketing the transforms with the two translations, the placement of the drawing on the page is preserved. Clipping Paths The clipping path is used to define the region that the normal path is actually painted. This can be used to create drawings that would otherwise be difficult to produce. import fpdf pdf = fpdf . FPDF ( unit = \"mm\" , format = ( 10 , 10 )) pdf . add_page () clipping_path = fpdf . drawing . ClippingPath () clipping_path . rectangle ( x = 2.5 , y = 2.5 , w = 5 , h = 5 , rx = 1 , ry = 1 ) with pdf . new_path () as path : path . style . fill_color = \"#A070D0\" path . style . stroke_color = fpdf . drawing . gray8 ( 210 ) path . style . stroke_width = 1 path . style . stroke_opacity = 0.75 path . style . stroke_join_style = \"round\" path . clipping_path = clipping_path path . move_to ( 2 , 2 ) path . line_to ( 8 , 8 ) path . horizontal_line_relative ( - 6 ) path . line_relative ( 6 , - 6 ) path . close () pdf . output ( \"drawing-demo.pdf\" ) view as PDF Next Steps The presented API style is designed to make it simple to produce shapes declaratively in your Python scripts.

Side by side images, full height, landscape page from fpdf import FPDF pdf = FPDF ( orientation = \"landscape\" ) pdf . set_margin ( 0 ) pdf . add_page () pdf . image ( \"imgA.png\" , h = pdf . eph , w = pdf . epw / 2 ) # full page height, half page width pdf . set_y ( 0 ) pdf . image ( \"imgB.jpg\" , h = pdf . eph , w = pdf . epw / 2 , x = pdf . epw / 2 ) # full page height, half page width, right half of the page pdf . output ( \"side-by-side.pdf\" ) Alternative description A textual description of the image can be provided, for accessibility purposes: pdf . image ( \"docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , x = 20 , y = 60 , alt_text = \"Snake logo of the fpdf2 library\" ) Usage with Pillow You can perform image manipulations using the Pillow library, and easily embed the result: from fpdf import FPDF from PIL import Image pdf = FPDF () pdf . add_page () img = Image . open ( \"docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" ) img = img . crop (( 10 , 10 , 490 , 490 )) . resize (( 96 , 96 ), resample = Image . NEAREST ) pdf . image ( img , x = 80 , y = 100 ) pdf . output ( \"pdf-with-image.pdf\" ) SVG images SVG images passed to the image() method will be embedded as PDF paths : from fpdf import FPDF pdf = FPDF () pdf . add_page () pdf . image ( \"SVG_logo.svg\" , w = 100 ) pdf . output ( \"pdf-with-vector-image.pdf\" ) Retrieve images from URLs URLs to images can be directly passed to the image() method: pdf . image ( \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Example.png\" ) Image compression By default, fpdf2 will avoid altering your images : no image conversion from / to PNG / JPEG is performed. However, you can easily tell fpdf2 to convert and embed all images as JPEGs in order to reduce your PDF size: from fpdf import FPDF pdf = FPDF () pdf . set_image_filter ( \"DCTDecode\" ) pdf . add_page () pdf . image ( \"docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , x = 20 , y = 60 ) pdf . output ( \"pdf-with-image.pdf\" ) Beware that \"flattening\" images this way will convert alpha channels to black. Oversized images detection & downscaling If the resulting PDF size is a concern, you may want to check if some inserted images are oversized , meaning their resolution is unnecessarily high given the size they are displayed. There is how to enable this detection mechanism with fpdf2 : pdf . oversized_images = \"WARN\" After setting this property, a WARNING log will be displayed whenever an oversized image is inserted. fpdf2 is also able to automatically downscale such oversized images: pdf . oversized_images = \"DOWNSCALE\" After this, oversized images will be automatically resized, generating DEBUG logs like this: OVERSIZED: Generated new low-res image with name=lowres-test.png dims=(319, 451) id=2 For finer control, you can set pdf.oversized_images_ratio to set the threshold determining if an image is oversized. If the concepts of \"image compression\" or \"image resolution\" are a bit obscure for you, this article is a recommended reading: The 5 minute guide to image quality Disabling transparency By default images transparency is preserved: alpha channels are extracted and converted to an embedded SMask . This can be disabled by setting .allow_images_transparency , e.g. to allow compliance with PDF/A-1 : from fpdf import FPDF pdf = FPDF () pdf . allow_images_transparency = False pdf . set_font ( \"Helvetica\" , size = 15 ) pdf . cell ( w = pdf . epw , h = 30 , txt = \"Text behind. \" * 6 ) pdf . image ( \"docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , x = 0 ) pdf . output ( \"pdf-including-image-without-transparency.pdf\" )","title":"Images"},{"location":"Images.html#images","text":"When rendering an image, its size on the page can be specified in several ways: explicit width and height (expressed in user units) one explicit dimension, the other being calculated automatically in order to keep the original proportions no explicit dimension, in which case the image is put at 72 dpi Note that if an image is displayed several times, only one copy is embedded in the file.","title":"Images"},{"location":"Images.html#simple-example","text":"from fpdf import FPDF pdf = FPDF () pdf . add_page () pdf . image ( \"docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , x = 20 , y = 60 ) pdf . output ( \"pdf-with-image.pdf\" )","title":"Simple example"},{"location":"Images.html#assembling-images","text":"fpdf2 can be an easy solution to assemble images into a PDF.

FPDF ( unit = \"pt\" , format = ( svg . width , svg . height )) pdf . add_page () svg . draw_to_page ( pdf ) pdf . output ( \"my_file.pdf\" ) Because this takes the PDF document size from the source SVG, it does assume that the width/height of the SVG are specified in absolute units rather than relative ones (i.e. the top-level <svg> tag has something like width=\"5cm\" and not width=50% ). In this case, if the values are percentages, they will be interpreted as their literal numeric value (i.e. 100% would be treated as 100 pt ). The next example uses transform_to_page_viewport , which will scale an SVG with a percentage based width to the pre-defined PDF page size.

These elements can act as placeholders, so the program can change the default text \"filling in\" the document. Besides being defined in code, the elements can also be defined in a CSV file or in a database, so the user can easily adapt the form to his printing needs. A template is used like a dict, setting its items' values. How to use Templates? There are two approaches to using templates, detailed in the sections below: Using Template() The traditional approach is to use the Template() class, This class accepts one template definition, and can apply it to each page of a document. The usage pattern here is: tmpl = Template ( elements = elements ) # first page and content tmpl . add_page () tmpl [ item_key_01 ] = \"Text 01\" tmpl [ item_key_02 ] = \"Text 02\" ... # second page and content tmpl . add_page () tmpl [ item_key_01 ] = \"Text 11\" tmpl [ item_key_02 ] = \"Text 12\" ... # possibly more pages ... # finalize document and write to file tmpl . render ( outfile = \"example.pdf\" ) The Template() class will create and manage its own FPDF() instance, so you don't need to worry about how it all works together. It also allows to set the page format, title of the document, measuring unit, and other metadata for the PDF file. For the method signatures, see pyfpdf.github.io: class Template . Setting text values for specific template items is done by treating the class as a dict, with the name of the item as the key: Template [ \"company_name\" ] = \"Sample Company\" Using FlexTemplate() When more flexibility is desired, then the FlexTemplate() class comes into play. In this case, you first need to create your own FPDF() instance. You can then pass this to the constructor of one or several FlexTemplate() instances, and have each of them load a template definition. For any page of the document, you can set text values on a template, and then render it on that page. After rendering, the template will be reset to its default values. pdf = FPDF () pdf . add_page () # One template for the first page fp_tmpl = FlexTemplate ( pdf , elements = fp_elements ) fp_tmpl [ \"item_key_01\" ] = \"Text 01\" fp_tmpl [ \"item_key_02\" ] = \"Text 02\" ... fp_tmpl . render () # add template items to first page # add some more non-template content to the first page pdf . polyline ( point_list , fill = False , polygon = False ) # second page pdf . add_page () # header for the second page h_tmpl = FlexTemplate ( pdf , elements = h_elements ) h_tmpl [ \"item_key_HA\" ] = \"Text 2A\" h_tmpl [ \"item_key_HB\" ] = \"Text 2B\" ... h_tmpl . render () # add header items to second page # footer for the second page f_tmpl = FlexTemplate ( pdf , elements = f_elements ) f_tmpl [ \"item_key_FC\" ] = \"Text 2C\" f_tmpl [ \"item_key_FD\" ] = \"Text 2D\" ... f_tmpl . render () # add footer items to second page # other content on the second page pdf . set_dash_pattern ( dash = 1 , gap = 1 ) pdf . line ( x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ): pdf . set_dash_pattern () # third page pdf . add_page () # header for the third page, just reuse the same template instance after render() h_tmpl [ \"item_key_HA\" ] = \"Text 3A\" h_tmpl [ \"item_key_HB\" ] = \"Text 3B\" ... h_tmpl . render () # add header items to third page # footer for the third page f_tmpl [ \"item_key_FC\" ] = \"Text 3C\" f_tmpl [ \"item_key_FD\" ] = \"Text 3D\" ... f_tmpl . render () # add footer items to third page # other content on the third page pdf . rect ( x , y , w , h , style = None ) # possibly more pages pdf . next_page () ... ... # finally write everything to a file pdf . output ( \"example.pdf\" ) Evidently, this can end up quite a bit more involved, but there are hardly any limits on how you can combine templated and non-templated content on each page. Just think of the different templates as of building blocks, like configurable rubber stamps, which you can apply in any combination on any page you like. Of course, you can just as well use a set of full-page templates, possibly differentiating between cover page, table of contents, normal content pages, and an index page, or something along those lines. And here's how you can use a template several times on one page (and by extension, several times on several pages). When rendering with an offsetx and/or offsety argument, the contents of the template will end up in a different place on the page. A rotate argument will change its orientation, rotated around the origin of the template. The pivot of the rotation is the offset location. And finally, a scale argument allows you to insert the template larger or smaller than it was defined. elements = [ { \"name\" : \"box\" , \"type\" : \"B\" , \"x1\" : 0 , \"y1\" : 0 , \"x2\" : 50 , \"y2\" : 50 ,}, { \"name\" : \"d1\" , \"type\" : \"L\" , \"x1\" : 0 , \"y1\" : 0 , \"x2\" : 50 , \"y2\" : 50 ,}, { \"name\" : \"d2\" , \"type\" : \"L\" , \"x1\" : 0 , \"y1\" : 50 , \"x2\" : 50 , \"y2\" : 0 ,}, { \"name\" : \"label\" , \"type\" : \"T\" , \"x1\" : 0 , \"y1\" : 52 , \"x2\" : 50 , \"y2\" : 57 , \"text\" : \"Label\" ,}, ] pdf = FPDF () pdf . add_page () templ = FlexTemplate ( pdf , elements ) templ [ \"label\" ] = \"Offset: 50 / 50 mm\" templ . render ( offsetx = 50 , offsety = 50 ) templ [ \"label\" ] = \"Offset: 50 / 120 mm\" templ . render ( offsetx = 50 , offsety = 120 ) templ [ \"label\" ] = \"Offset: 120 / 50 mm, Scale: 0.5\" templ . render ( offsetx = 120 , offsety = 50 , scale = 0.5 ) templ [ \"label\" ] = \"Offset: 120 / 120 mm, Rotate: 30\u00b0, Scale=0.5\" templ . render ( offsetx = 120 , offsety = 120 , rotate = 30.0 , scale = 0.5 ) pdf . output ( \"example.pdf\" ) For the method signatures, see pyfpdf.github.io: class FlexTemplate . The dict syntax for setting text values is the same as above: FlexTemplate [ \"company_name\" ] = \"Sample Company\" Details - Template definition A template definition consists of a number of elements, which have the following properties (columns in a CSV, items in a dict, fields in a database). Dimensions (except font size, which always uses points) are given in user defined units (default: mm). Those are the units that can be specified when creating a Template() or a FPDF() instance. name : placeholder identification (unique text string) mandatory type : ' T ': Text - places one or several lines of text on the page ' L ': Line - draws a line from x1/y1 to x2/y2 ' I ': Image - positions and scales an image into the bounding box ' B ': Box - draws a rectangle around the bounding box ' E ': Ellipse - draws an ellipse inside the bounding box ' BC ': Barcode - inserts an \"Interleaved 2 of 5\" type barcode ' C39 ': Code 39 - inserts a \"Code 39\" type barcode Incompatible change: A previous implementation of this type used the non-standard element keys \"x\", \"y\", \"w\", and \"h\", which are now deprecated (but still work for the moment). ' W ': \"Write\" - uses the FPDF.write() method to add text to the page mandatory x1, y1, x2, y2 : top-left, bottom-right coordinates, defining a bounding box in most cases for multiline text, this is the bounding box of just the first line, not the complete box for the barcodes types, the height of the barcode is y2 - y1 , x2 is ignored. mandatory (\"x2\" optional for the barcode types) font : the name of a font type for the text types optional default: \"helvetica\" size : the size property of the element (float value) for text, the font size (in points!) for line, box, and ellipse, the line width for the barcode types, the width of one bar optional default: 10 for text, 2 for 'BC', 1.5 for 'C39' bold, italic, underline : text style properties in elements dict, enabled with True or equivalent value in csv, only int values, 0 as false, non-0 as true optional default: false foreground, background : text and fill colors (int value, commonly given in hex as 0xRRGGBB) optional default: foreground 0x000000 = black; background None/empty = transparent Incompatible change: Up to 2.4.5, the default background for text and box elements was solid white, with no way to make them transparent. align : text alignment, ' L ': left, ' R ': right, ' C ': center optional default: 'L' text : default string, can be replaced at runtime displayed text for 'T' and 'W' data to encode for barcode types optional (if missing for text/write, the element is ignored) default: empty priority : Z-order (int value) optional default: 0 multiline : configure text wrapping in dicts, None for single line, True for multicells (multiple lines), False trims to exactly fit the space defined in csv, 0 for single line, >0 for multiple lines, <0 for exact fit optional default: single line rotation : rotate the element in degrees around the top left corner x1/y1 (float) optional default: 0.0 - no rotation Fields that are not relevant to a specific element type will be ignored there, but if not left empty, they must still adhere to the specified data type (in dicts, string fields may be None). How to create a template A template can be created in 3 ways: By defining everything manually in a hardcoded way as a Python dictionary By using a template definition in a CSV document and parsing the CSV with Template.parse_dict() By defining the template in a database (this applies to [Web2Py] (Web2Py.md) integration) Example - Hardcoded from fpdf import Template #this will define the ELEMENTS that will compose the template. elements = [ { 'name' : 'company_logo' , 'type' : 'I' , 'x1' : 20.0 , 'y1' : 17.0 , 'x2' : 78.0 , 'y2' : 30.0 , 'font' : None , 'size' : 0.0 , 'bold' : 0 , 'italic' : 0 , 'underline' : 0 , 'foreground' : 0 , 'background' : 0 , 'align' : 'I' , 'text' : 'logo' , 'priority' : 2 , 'multiline' : 0 }, { 'name' : 'company_name' , 'type' : 'T' , 'x1' : 17.0 , 'y1' : 32.5 , 'x2' : 115.0 , 'y2' : 37.5 , 'font' : 'helvetica' , 'size' : 12.0 , 'bold' : 1 , 'italic' : 0 , 'underline' : 0 , 'foreground' : 0 , 'background' : 0 , 'align' : 'I' , 'text' : '' , 'priority' : 2 , 'multiline' : 0 }, { 'name' : 'multline_text' , 'type' : 'T' , 'x1' : 20 , 'y1' : 100 , 'x2' : 40 , 'y2' : 105 , 'font' : 'helvetica' , 'size' : 12 , 'bold' : 0 , 'italic' : 0 , 'underline' : 0 , 'foreground' : 0 , 'background' : 0x88ff00 , 'align' : 'I' , 'text' : 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisici elit' , 'priority' : 2 , 'multiline' : 1 } { 'name' : 'box' , 'type' : 'B' , 'x1' : 15.0 , 'y1' : 15.0 , 'x2' : 185.0 , 'y2' : 260.0 , 'font' : 'helvetica' , 'size' : 0.0 , 'bold' : 0 , 'italic' : 0 , 'underline' : 0 , 'foreground' : 0 , 'background' : 0 , 'align' : 'I' , 'text' : None , 'priority' : 0 , 'multiline' : 0 }, { 'name' : 'box_x' , 'type' : 'B' , 'x1' : 95.0 , 'y1' : 15.0 , 'x2' : 105.0 , 'y2' : 25.0 , 'font' : 'helvetica' , 'size' : 0.0 , 'bold' : 1 , 'italic' : 0 , 'underline' : 0 , 'foreground' : 0 , 'background' : 0 , 'align' : 'I' , 'text' : None , 'priority' : 2 , 'multiline' : 0 }, { 'name' : 'line1' , 'type' : 'L' , 'x1' : 100.0 , 'y1' : 25.0 , 'x2' : 100.0 , 'y2' : 57.0 , 'font' : 'helvetica' , 'size' : 0 , 'bold' : 0 , 'italic' : 0 , 'underline' : 0 , 'foreground' : 0 , 'background' : 0 , 'align' : 'I' , 'text' : None , 'priority' : 3 , 'multiline' : 0 }, { 'name' : 'barcode' , 'type' : 'BC' , 'x1' : 20.0 , 'y1' : 246.5 , 'x2' : 140.0 , 'y2' : 254.0 , 'font' : 'Interleaved 2of5 NT' , 'size' : 0.75 , 'bold' : 0 , 'italic' : 0 , 'underline' : 0 , 'foreground' : 0 , 'background' : 0 , 'align' : 'I' , 'text' : '200000000001000159053338016581200810081' , 'priority' : 3 , 'multiline' : 0 }, ] #here we instantiate the template f = Template ( format = \"A4\" , elements = elements , title = \"Sample Invoice\" ) f . add_page () #we FILL some of the fields of the template with the information we want #note we access the elements treating the template instance as a \"dict\" f [ \"company_name\" ] = \"Sample Company\" f [ \"company_logo\" ] = \"docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" #and now we render the page f . render ( \"./template.pdf\" ) See template.py or [Web2Py] (Web2Py.md) for a complete example. Example - Elements defined in CSV file You define your elements in a CSV file \"mycsvfile.csv\" that will look like: line0;L;20.0;12.0;190.0;12.0;times;0.5;0;0;0;0;16777215;C;;0;0;0.0 line1;L;20.0;36.0;190.0;36.0;times;0.5;0;0;0;0;16777215;C;;0;0;0.0 name0;T;21.0;14.0;104.0;25.0;times;16.0;0;0;0;0;16777215;L;name;2;0;0.0 title0;T;21.0;26.0;104.0;30.0;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;16777215;L;title;2;0;0.0 multiline;T;21.0;50.0;28.0;54.0;times;10.5;0;0;0;0;0xffff00;L;multi line;0;1;0.0 numeric_text;T;21.0;80.0;100.0;84.0;times;10.5;0;0;0;0;;R;007;0;0;0.0 empty_fields;T;21.0;100.0;100.0;104.0 rotated;T;21.0;80.0;100.0;84.0;times;10.5;0;0;0;0;;R;ROTATED;0;0;30.0 Remember that each line represents an element and each field represents one of the properties of the element in the following order: ('name','type','x1','y1','x2','y2','font','size','bold','italic','underline','foreground','background','align','text','priority', 'multiline', 'rotate') As noted above, most fields may be left empty, so a line is valid with only 6 items. The \"empty_fields\" line of the example demonstrates all that can be left away. In addition, for the barcode types \"x2\" may be empty. Then you can use the file like this: def test_template (): f = Template ( format = \"A4\" , title = \"Sample Invoice\" ) f . parse_csv ( \"mycsvfile.csv\" , delimiter = \";\" ) f . add_page () f [ \"name0\" ] = \"Joe Doe\" return f . render ( \"./template.pdf\" )","title":"Templates"},{"location":"Templates.html#templates","text":"Templates are predefined documents (like invoices, tax forms, etc.), or parts of such documents, where each element (text, lines, barcodes, etc.) has a fixed position (x1, y1, x2, y2), style (font, size, etc.) and a default text. These elements can act as placeholders, so the program can change the default text \"filling in\" the document. Besides being defined in code, the elements can also be defined in a CSV file or in a database, so the user can easily adapt the form to his printing needs. A template is used like a dict, setting its items' values. How to use Templates? There are two approaches to using templates, detailed in the sections below:","title":"Templates"},{"location":"Templates.html#using-template","text":"The traditional approach is to use the Template() class, This class accepts one template definition, and can apply it to each page of a document. The usage pattern here is: tmpl = Template ( elements = elements ) # first page and content tmpl . add_page () tmpl [ item_key_01 ] = \"Text 01\" tmpl [ item_key_02 ] = \"Text 02\" ... # second page and content tmpl . add_page () tmpl [ item_key_01 ] = \"Text 11\" tmpl [ item_key_02 ] = \"Text 12\" ... # possibly more pages ... # finalize document and write to file tmpl . render ( outfile = \"example.pdf\" ) The Template() class will create and manage its own FPDF() instance, so you don't need to worry about how it all works together. It also allows to set the page format, title of the document, measuring unit, and other metadata for the PDF file. For the method signatures, see pyfpdf.github.io: class Template . Setting text values for specific template items is done by treating the class as a dict, with the name of the item as the key: Template [ \"company_name\" ] = \"Sample Company\"","title":"Using Template()"},{"location":"Templates.html#using-flextemplate","text":"When more flexibility is desired, then the FlexTemplate() class comes into play. In this case, you first need to create your own FPDF() instance. You can then pass this to the constructor of one or several FlexTemplate() instances, and have each of them load a template definition. For any page of the document, you can set text values on a template, and then render it on that page. After rendering, the template will be reset to its default values. pdf = FPDF () pdf . add_page () # One template for the first page fp_tmpl = FlexTemplate ( pdf , elements = fp_elements ) fp_tmpl [ \"item_key_01\" ] = \"Text 01\" fp_tmpl [ \"item_key_02\" ] = \"Text 02\" ... fp_tmpl . render () # add template items to first page # add some more non-template content to the first page pdf . polyline ( point_list , fill = False , polygon = False ) # second page pdf . add_page () # header for the second page h_tmpl = FlexTemplate ( pdf , elements = h_elements ) h_tmpl [ \"item_key_HA\" ] = \"Text 2A\" h_tmpl [ \"item_key_HB\" ] = \"Text 2B\" ... h_tmpl . render () # add header items to second page # footer for the second page f_tmpl = FlexTemplate ( pdf , elements = f_elements ) f_tmpl [ \"item_key_FC\" ] = \"Text 2C\" f_tmpl [ \"item_key_FD\" ] = \"Text 2D\" ... f_tmpl . render () # add footer items to second page # other content on the second page pdf . set_dash_pattern ( dash = 1 , gap = 1 ) pdf . line ( x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ): pdf . set_dash_pattern () # third page pdf . add_page () # header for the third page, just reuse the same template instance after render() h_tmpl [ \"item_key_HA\" ] = \"Text 3A\" h_tmpl [ \"item_key_HB\" ] = \"Text 3B\" ... h_tmpl . render () # add header items to third page # footer for the third page f_tmpl [ \"item_key_FC\" ] = \"Text 3C\" f_tmpl [ \"item_key_FD\" ] = \"Text 3D\" ... f_tmpl . render () # add footer items to third page # other content on the third page pdf . rect ( x , y , w , h , style = None ) # possibly more pages pdf . next_page () ... ... # finally write everything to a file pdf . output ( \"example.pdf\" ) Evidently, this can end up quite a bit more involved, but there are hardly any limits on how you can combine templated and non-templated content on each page. Just think of the different templates as of building blocks, like configurable rubber stamps, which you can apply in any combination on any page you like. Of course, you can just as well use a set of full-page templates, possibly differentiating between cover page, table of contents, normal content pages, and an index page, or something along those lines.

Der FPDF Konstruktor wird hier mit den Standardwerten verwendet: Das Seitenformat wird auf A4-Hochformat gesetzt und als Ma\u00dfeinheit Millimeter festgelegt. Diese Werte h\u00e4tten wir auch explizit angegeben k\u00f6nnen: pdf = FPDF ( orientation = \"P\" , unit = \"mm\" , format = \"A4\" ) Es ist auch m\u00f6glich, eine PDF-Datei im Querformat zu erstellen ( L ), sowie andere Seitenformate ( Letter und Legal ) und Ma\u00dfeinheiten ( pt , cm , in ) zu verwenden. Bisher haben wir dem Dokument noch keine Seite hinzugef\u00fcgt. Um eine Seite hinzuzuf\u00fcgen, verwenden wir add_page . Der Ursprung der Koordinaten liegt in der oberen linken Ecke und die aktuelle Schreibposition ist standardm\u00e4\u00dfig jeweils 1 cm von den R\u00e4ndern entfernt. Diese Randabst\u00e4nde k\u00f6nnen mit set_margins angespasst werden. Bevor wir Text hinzuf\u00fcgen k\u00f6nnen, m\u00fcssen wir zuerst mit set_font eine Schriftart festlegen, um ein g\u00fcltiges Dokument zu erzeugen. Wir w\u00e4hlen Helvetica, fett in Schriftgr\u00f6\u00dfe 16 pt: pdf . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'B' , 16 ) Anstelle von B h\u00e4tten wir mit I kursiv , U unterstichen oder durch die \u00dcbergabe einer leeren Zeichenkette einen \"normale\" Textstil w\u00e4hlen k\u00f6nnen. Beliebige Kombinationen der drei Werte sind zul\u00e4ssig. Beachte, dass die Schriftgr\u00f6\u00dfe in Punkt und nicht in Millimetern (oder einer anderen durch den Benutzer bei der Erstellung mit unit= festgelegten Ma\u00dfeinheit) angegeben wird. Dies ist die einzige Ausnahme vom Grundsatz, dass immer die durch den Benutzer gew\u00e4hlte Ma\u00dfeinheit bei der Festlegung von Positions- oder Gr\u00f6\u00dfenangaben genutzt wird. Neben Helvetica stehen Times , Courier , Symbol und ZapfDingbats als Standardschriftarten zur Verf\u00fcgung. Wir k\u00f6nnen jetzt eine erste Textzelle mit cell einf\u00fcgen. Eine Zelle ist ein rechteckiger Bereich - optional umrahmt - der Text enthalten kann. Sie wird an der jeweils aktuellen Schreibposition gerendert. Wir k\u00f6nnen die Abmessungen der Zelle, den Text und dessen Formatierung (zentriert oder ausgerichtet), einen ggf. gew\u00fcnschten Rahmen und die Festlegung der neuen Schreibposition nach dem Schreiben der Zelle (rechts, unten oder am Anfang der n\u00e4chsten Zeile) bestimmen. Um einen Rahmen hinzuzuf\u00fcgen, w\u00fcrden wir die Methode folgenderma\u00dfen einbinden: pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , 'Hello World!' , 1 ) Um eine neue Zelle mit zentriertem Text hinzuzuf\u00fcgen und anschlie\u00dfend in die n\u00e4chste Zeile zu springen, k\u00f6nnen wir Folgendes schreiben: pdf . cell ( 60 , 10 , 'Powered by FPDF.' , ln = 1 , align = 'C' ) Anmerkung : Der Zeilenumbruch kann auch mit ln erfolgen. Diese Methode erlaubt es, zus\u00e4tzlich die H\u00f6he des Umbruchs anzugeben. Schlie\u00dflich wird das Dokument mit output geschlossen und unter dem angegebenen Dateipfad gespeichert. Ohne Angabe eines Parameters liefert output() den PDF bytearray -Puffer zur\u00fcck. Lektion 2 - Kopfzeile, Fu\u00dfzeile, Seitenumbruch und Bild Hier ein zweiseitiges Beispiel mit Kopfzeile, Fu\u00dfzeile und Logo: from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def header ( self ): # Rendering logo: self . image ( \"../docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , 10 , 8 , 33 ) # Setting font: helvetica bold 15 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) # Moving cursor to the right: self . cell ( 80 ) # Printing title: self . cell ( 30 , 10 , \"Title\" , 1 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 20 ) def footer ( self ): # Position cursor at 1.5 cm from bottom: self . set_y ( - 15 ) # Setting font: helvetica italic 8 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) # Printing page number: self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } / {{ nb }} \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Instantiation of inherited class pdf = PDF () pdf . alias_nb_pages () pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) for i in range ( 1 , 41 ): pdf . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Printing line number { i } \" , 0 , 1 ) pdf . output ( \"tuto2.pdf\" ) Erzeugtes PDF Dieses Beispiel verwendet die Methoden header und footer , um Kopf- und Fu\u00dfzeilen zu verarbeiten. Sie werden jeweils automatisch aufgerufen. Die Methode 'header' direkt nach dem Hinzug\u00fcgen einer neuen Seite, die Methode 'footer' wenn die Bearbeitung einer Seite durch das Hinzuf\u00fcgen einer weiteren Seite oder das Abspeichern des Dokuments abgeschlossen wird. Die Methoden existieren bereits in der Klasse FPDF, sind aber leer. Um sie zu nutzen, m\u00fcssen wir die Klasse erweitern und sie \u00fcberschreiben. Das Logo wird mit der Methode image eingebunden, und auf der Seite durch die Angabe der Position der linken oberen Ecke und die gew\u00fcnschte Bildbreite platziert. Die H\u00f6he wird automatisch berechnet, um die Proportionen des Bildes zu erhalten. Um die Seitenzahl einzuf\u00fcgenn, \u00fcbergeben wir zuerst der Zelle einen Nullwert als Breite der Zelle. Das bedeutet, dass die Zelle bis zum rechten Rand der Seite reichen soll. Das ist besonders praktisch, um Text zu zentrieren. Die aktuelle Seitenzahl wird durch die Methode page_no ermittelt und in die Zelle geschrieben. Die Gesamtseitenzahl wird mit Hilfe des speziellen Platzhalterwertes {nb} ermittelt, der beim Schlie\u00dfen des Dokuments ersetzt wird (vorausgesetzt, du hast vorher alias_nb_pages ) aufgerufen. Beachte die Verwendung der Methode set_y , mit der du die vertikale Schreibposition an einer absoluten Stelle der Seite - von oben oder von unten aus - setzen kannst. Eine weitere interessante Funktion wird hier ebenfalls verwendet: der automatische Seitenumbruch. Sobald eine Zelle eine festgelegte Grenze in der Seite \u00fcberschreitet (standardm\u00e4\u00dfig 2 Zentimeter vom unteren Rand), wird ein Seitenumbruch durchgef\u00fchrt und die Einstellungen der gewahlten Schrift auf der n\u00e4chsten Seite automatisch beibehalten. Obwohl die Kopf- und Fu\u00dfzeilen ihre eigene Schriftart ( Helvetica ) w\u00e4hlen, wird im Textk\u00f6rper Times verwendet. Dieser Mechanismus der automatischen \u00dcbernahme der Einstellungen nach Seitenumbruch gilt auch f\u00fcr Farben und Zeilenbreite. Der Grenzwert, der den Seitenumbruch ausl\u00f6st, kann mit set_auto_page_break festgelegt werden . Lektion 3 - Zeilenumbr\u00fcche und Farben Fahren wir mit einem Beispiel fort, das Abs\u00e4tze im Blocksatz ausgibt. Es demonstriert auch die Verwendung von Farben. from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def header ( self ): # Setting font: helvetica bold 15 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) # Calculating width of title and setting cursor position: width = self . get_string_width ( self . title ) + 6 self . set_x (( 210 - width ) / 2 ) # Setting colors for frame, background and text: self . set_draw_color ( 0 , 80 , 180 ) self . set_fill_color ( 230 , 230 , 0 ) self . set_text_color ( 220 , 50 , 50 ) # Setting thickness of the frame (1 mm) self . set_line_width ( 1 ) # Printing title: self . cell ( width , 9 , self . title , 1 , 1 , \"C\" , True ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 10 ) def footer ( self ): # Setting position at 1.5 cm from bottom: self . set_y ( - 15 ) # Setting font: helvetica italic 8 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) # Setting text color to gray: self . set_text_color ( 128 ) # Printing page number self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) def chapter_title ( self , num , label ): # Setting font: helvetica 12 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"\" , 12 ) # Setting background color self . set_fill_color ( 200 , 220 , 255 ) # Printing chapter name: self . cell ( 0 , 6 , f \"Chapter { num } : { label } \" , 0 , 1 , \"L\" , True ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 4 ) def chapter_body ( self , filepath ): # Reading text file: with open ( filepath , \"rb\" ) as fh : txt = fh . read () . decode ( \"latin-1\" ) # Setting font: Times 12 self . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) # Printing justified text: self . multi_cell ( 0 , 5 , txt ) # Performing a line break: self . ln () # Final mention in italics: self . set_font ( style = \"I\" ) self . cell ( 0 , 5 , \"(end of excerpt)\" ) def print_chapter ( self , num , title , filepath ): self . add_page () self . chapter_title ( num , title ) self . chapter_body ( filepath ) pdf = PDF () pdf . set_title ( \"20000 Leagues Under the Seas\" ) pdf . set_author ( \"Jules Verne\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 1 , \"A RUNAWAY REEF\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 2 , \"THE PROS AND CONS\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto3.pdf\" ) Resulting PDF Jules Verne text Die Methode get_string_width erm\u00f6glicht die Bestimmung die Breite des \u00fcbergebenen Textes in der aktuellen Schriftart. Das Beispiel nutzt sie zur Berechnung der Position und der Breite des Rahmens, der den Titel umgibt. Anschlie\u00dfend werden die Farben mit set_draw_color , set_fill_color und und set_text_color gesetzt und die Linienst\u00e4rke mit set_line_width auf 1 mm (Abweichend vom Standardwert von 0,2) festgelegt. Schlie\u00dflich geben wir die Zelle aus (Der letzte Parameter True zeigt an, dass der Hintergrund gef\u00fcllt werden muss). Zur Erstellung von Abs\u00e4tzen wir die Methode multi_cell genutzt. Jedes Mal, wenn eine Zeile den rechten Rand der Zelle erreicht oder ein Zeilenumbruchzeichen \\\\n im Text erkannt wird, wird ein Zeilenumbruch durchgef\u00fchrt und automatisch eine neue Zelle unterhalb der aktuellen Zelle erstellt. Der Text wird standardm\u00e4\u00dfig im Blocksatz ausgerichtet. Es werden zwei Dokumenteigenschaften definiert: Titel ( set_title ) und Autor ( set_author ). Dokumenteneigenschaften k\u00f6nnen auf zwei Arten eingesehen werden. Man kann das Dokument mit dem Acrobat Reader \u00f6ffnen und im Men\u00fc Datei die Option Dokumenteigenschaften ausw\u00e4hlen. Alternativ kann man auch mit der rechten Maustaste auf das Dokument klicken und die Option Dokumenteigenschaften w\u00e4hlen. Lektion 4 - Mehrspaltiger Text Dieses Beispiel ist eine Abwandlung des vorherigen Beispiels und zeigt, wie sich Text \u00fcber mehrere Spalten verteilen l\u00e4sst. from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def __init__ ( self ): super () . __init__ () self . col = 0 # Current column self . y0 = 0 # Ordinate of column start def header ( self ): self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) width = self . get_string_width ( self . title ) + 6 self . set_x (( 210 - width ) / 2 ) self . set_draw_color ( 0 , 80 , 180 ) self . set_fill_color ( 230 , 230 , 0 ) self . set_text_color ( 220 , 50 , 50 ) self . set_line_width ( 1 ) self . cell ( width , 9 , self . title , 1 , 1 , \"C\" , True ) self . ln ( 10 ) # Saving ordinate position: self . y0 = self . get_y () def footer ( self ): self . set_y ( - 15 ) self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) self . set_text_color ( 128 ) self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) def set_col ( self , col ): # Set column position: self . col = col x = 10 + col * 65 self . set_left_margin ( x ) self . set_x ( x ) @property def accept_page_break ( self ): if self . col < 2 : # Go to next column: self . set_col ( self . col + 1 ) # Set ordinate to top: self . set_y ( self . y0 ) # Stay on the same page: return False # Go back to first column: self . set_col ( 0 ) # Trigger a page break: return True def chapter_title ( self , num , label ): self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"\" , 12 ) self . set_fill_color ( 200 , 220 , 255 ) self . cell ( 0 , 6 , f \"Chapter { num } : { label } \" , 0 , 1 , \"L\" , True ) self . ln ( 4 ) # Saving ordinate position: self . y0 = self . get_y () def chapter_body ( self , name ): # Reading text file: with open ( name , \"rb\" ) as fh : txt = fh . read () . decode ( \"latin-1\" ) # Setting font: Times 12 self . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) # Printing text in a 6cm width column: self . multi_cell ( 60 , 5 , txt ) self . ln () # Final mention in italics: self . set_font ( style = \"I\" ) self . cell ( 0 , 5 , \"(end of excerpt)\" ) # Start back at first column: self . set_col ( 0 ) def print_chapter ( self , num , title , name ): self . add_page () self . chapter_title ( num , title ) self . chapter_body ( name ) pdf = PDF () pdf . set_title ( \"20000 Leagues Under the Seas\" ) pdf . set_author ( \"Jules Verne\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 1 , \"A RUNAWAY REEF\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 2 , \"THE PROS AND CONS\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto4.pdf\" ) Erzeugtes PDF Jules Verne Text Der Hauptunterschied zur vorherigen Lektion ist die Verwendung der Methoden accept_page_break und set_col . Wird accept_page_break verwendet, wird die aktuelle Spaltennummer \u00fcberpr\u00fcft, sobald die Zelle den zur Ausl\u00f6sung eines Seitenumbruchs festgelegten Abstand zum unteren Seitenrand (Standard 2cm) \u00fcberschreitet. Ist die Spaltennummer kleiner als 2 (wir haben uns entschieden, die Seite in drei Spalten zu unterteilen), wird die Methode set_col aufgerufen. Sie erh\u00f6ht die Spaltennummer auf die n\u00e4chsth\u00f6here und setzt die Schreibposition auf den Anfang der n\u00e4chsten Spalte, damit der Text dort fortgesetzt werden kann. Sobald det Text der dritten den oben beschriebenen Abstand zum Seitenende erreicht, wird durch die Methode accept_page_break ein Seitenumbruch ausgel\u00f6st und die aktive Spalte sowie Schreibposition zur\u00fcckgesetzt. Lektion 5 - Tabellen erstellen In dieser Lektion zeigen wir, wie man auf einfache Weise Tabellen erstellen kann. Der Code wird drei verschiedene Tabellen erstellen, um zu zeigen, welche Effekte wir mit einigen einfachen Anpassungen erzielen k\u00f6nnen. import csv from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def basic_table ( self , headings , rows ): for heading in headings : self . cell ( 40 , 7 , heading , 1 ) self . ln () for row in rows : for col in row : self . cell ( 40 , 6 , col , 1 ) self . ln () def improved_table ( self , headings , rows , col_widths = ( 42 , 39 , 35 , 40 )): for col_width , heading in zip ( col_widths , headings ): self . cell ( col_width , 7 , heading , 1 , 0 , \"C\" ) self . ln () for row in rows : self . cell ( col_widths [ 0 ], 6 , row [ 0 ], \"LR\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 1 ], 6 , row [ 1 ], \"LR\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 2 ], 6 , row [ 2 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 3 ], 6 , row [ 3 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" ) self . ln () # Closure line: self . cell ( sum ( col_widths ), 0 , \"\" , \"T\" ) def colored_table ( self , headings , rows , col_widths = ( 42 , 39 , 35 , 42 )): # Colors, line width and bold font: self . set_fill_color ( 255 , 100 , 0 ) self . set_text_color ( 255 ) self . set_draw_color ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) self . set_line_width ( 0.3 ) self . set_font ( style = \"B\" ) for col_width , heading in zip ( col_widths , headings ): self . cell ( col_width , 7 , heading , 1 , 0 , \"C\" , True ) self . ln () # Color and font restoration: self . set_fill_color ( 224 , 235 , 255 ) self . set_text_color ( 0 ) self . set_font () fill = False for row in rows : self . cell ( col_widths [ 0 ], 6 , row [ 0 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"L\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 1 ], 6 , row [ 1 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"L\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 2 ], 6 , row [ 2 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 3 ], 6 , row [ 3 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" , fill ) self . ln () fill = not fill self . cell ( sum ( col_widths ), 0 , \"\" , \"T\" ) def load_data_from_csv ( csv_filepath ): headings , rows = [], [] with open ( csv_filepath , encoding = \"utf8\" ) as csv_file : for row in csv . reader ( csv_file , delimiter = \",\" ): if not headings : # extracting column names from first row: headings = row else : rows . append ( row ) return headings , rows col_names , data = load_data_from_csv ( \"countries.txt\" ) pdf = PDF () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , size = 14 ) pdf . add_page () pdf . basic_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . add_page () pdf . improved_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . add_page () pdf . colored_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . output ( \"tuto5.pdf\" ) Erzeugtes PDF - L\u00e4nder Da eine Tabelle lediglich eine Sammlung von Zellen darstellt, ist es naheliegend, eine Tabelle aus den bereits bekannten Zellen aufzubauen. Das erste Beispiel wird auf die einfachste Art und Weise realisiert. Einfach gerahmte Zellen, die alle die gleiche Gr\u00f6\u00dfe haben und linksb\u00fcndig ausgerichtet sind. Das Ergebnis ist rudiment\u00e4r, aber sehr schnell zu erzielen. Die zweite Tabelle bringt einige Verbesserungen: Jede Spalte hat ihre eigene Breite, die \u00dcberschriften sind zentriert und die Zahlen rechtsb\u00fcndig ausgerichtet. Au\u00dferdem wurden die horizontalen Linien entfernt. Dies geschieht mit Hilfe des Randparameters der Methode cell() , der angibt, welche Seiten der Zelle gezeichnet werden m\u00fcssen. Im Beispiel w\u00e4hlen wir die linke (L) und die rechte (R) Seite. Jetzt muss nur noch das Problem der horizontalen Linie zum Abschluss der Tabelle gel\u00f6st werden. Es gibt zwei M\u00f6glichkeiten, es zu l\u00f6sen: In der Schleife pr\u00fcfen, ob wir uns in der letzten Zeile befinden und dann \"LRB\" als Rahmenparameter \u00fcbergeben oder, wie hier geschehen, eine abschlie\u00dfende Zelle separat nach dem Durchlaufen der Schleife einf\u00fcgen. Die dritte Tabelle der zweiten sehr \u00e4hnlich, verwendet aber zus\u00e4tzlich Farben. F\u00fcllung, Text und Linienfarben werden einfach mit den entsprechenden Methoden gesetzt. Eine wechselnde F\u00e4rbung der Zeilen wird durch die abwechselnde Verwendung transparenter und gef\u00fcllter Zellen erreicht. Lektion 6 - Links erstellen und Textstile mischen In dieser Lektion werden verschiedene M\u00f6glichkeiten der Erstellung interner und externer Links beschrieben. Es wird auch gezeigt, wie man verschiedene Textstile (fett, kursiv, unterstrichen) innerhalb eines Textes verwenden kann. from fpdf import FPDF , HTMLMixin class MyFPDF ( FPDF , HTMLMixin ): pass pdf = MyFPDF () # First page: pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , size = 20 ) pdf . write ( 5 , \"To find out what's new in self tutorial, click \" ) pdf . set_font ( style = \"U\" ) link = pdf . add_link () pdf . write ( 5 , \"here\" , link ) pdf . set_font () # Second page: pdf . add_page () pdf . set_link ( link ) pdf . image ( \"../docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , 10 , 10 , 50 , 0 , \"\" , \"https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/\" ) pdf . set_left_margin ( 60 ) pdf . set_font_size ( 18 ) pdf . write_html ( \"\"\"You can print text mixing different styles using HTML tags: <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underlined</u>, or <b><i><u>all at once</u></i></b>! <br><br>You can also insert links on text, such as <a href=\"https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/\">https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/</a>, or on an image: the logo is clickable!\"\"\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto6.pdf\" ) Erzeugtes PDF - fpdf2-logo Die hier gezeigte neue Methode zur Einbindung von Text lautet write() . Sie \u00e4hnelt der bereits bekannten multi_cell() . Die wichtigsten Unterschiede sind: Das Ende der Zeile befindet sich am rechten Rand und die n\u00e4chste Zeile beginnt am linken Rand. Die aktuelle Position wird an das Textende gesetzt. Die Methode erm\u00f6glicht es uns somit, zuerst einen Textabschnitt zu schreiben, dann den Schriftstil zu \u00e4ndern und genau an der Stelle fortzufahren, an der wir aufgeh\u00f6rt haben. Der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Nachteil ist jedoch, dass die von multi_cell() bekannte M\u00f6glichkeit zur Festlegung der Textausrichtung fehlt. Auf der ersten Seite des Beispiels nutzen wir write() . Der Anfang des Satzes wird in \"normalem\" Stil geschrieben, dann mit der Methode set_font() auf Unterstreichung umgestellt und der Satz beendet. Um einen internen Link hinzuzuf\u00fcgen, der auf die zweite Seite verweist, nutzen wir die Methode add_link() , die einen anklickbaren Bereich erzeugt, den wir \"link\" nennen und der auf eine andere Stelle innerhalb des Dokuments verweist. Auf der zweiten Seite verwenden wir set_link() , um den Zielbereich f\u00fcr den soeben erstellten Link zu definieren. Um einen externen Link mit Hilfe eines Bildes zu erstellen, verwenden wir image() . Es besteht die M\u00f6glichkeit, der Methode ein Linkziel als eines ihrer Argumente zu \u00fcbergeben.

Der FPDF Konstruktor wird hier mit den Standardwerten verwendet: Das Seitenformat wird auf A4-Hochformat gesetzt und als Ma\u00dfeinheit Millimeter festgelegt. Diese Werte h\u00e4tten wir auch explizit angegeben k\u00f6nnen: pdf = FPDF ( orientation = \"P\" , unit = \"mm\" , format = \"A4\" ) Es ist auch m\u00f6glich, eine PDF-Datei im Querformat zu erstellen ( L ), sowie andere Seitenformate ( Letter und Legal ) und Ma\u00dfeinheiten ( pt , cm , in ) zu verwenden. Bisher haben wir dem Dokument noch keine Seite hinzugef\u00fcgt. Um eine Seite hinzuzuf\u00fcgen, verwenden wir add_page . Der Ursprung der Koordinaten liegt in der oberen linken Ecke und die aktuelle Schreibposition ist standardm\u00e4\u00dfig jeweils 1 cm von den R\u00e4ndern entfernt. Diese Randabst\u00e4nde k\u00f6nnen mit set_margins angespasst werden. Bevor wir Text hinzuf\u00fcgen k\u00f6nnen, m\u00fcssen wir zuerst mit set_font eine Schriftart festlegen, um ein g\u00fcltiges Dokument zu erzeugen. Wir w\u00e4hlen Helvetica, fett in Schriftgr\u00f6\u00dfe 16 pt: pdf . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'B' , 16 ) Anstelle von B h\u00e4tten wir mit I kursiv , U unterstichen oder durch die \u00dcbergabe einer leeren Zeichenkette einen \"normale\" Textstil w\u00e4hlen k\u00f6nnen. Beliebige Kombinationen der drei Werte sind zul\u00e4ssig. Beachte, dass die Schriftgr\u00f6\u00dfe in Punkt und nicht in Millimetern (oder einer anderen durch den Benutzer bei der Erstellung mit unit= festgelegten Ma\u00dfeinheit) angegeben wird. Dies ist die einzige Ausnahme vom Grundsatz, dass immer die durch den Benutzer gew\u00e4hlte Ma\u00dfeinheit bei der Festlegung von Positions- oder Gr\u00f6\u00dfenangaben genutzt wird. Neben Helvetica stehen Times , Courier , Symbol und ZapfDingbats als Standardschriftarten zur Verf\u00fcgung. Wir k\u00f6nnen jetzt eine erste Textzelle mit cell einf\u00fcgen. Eine Zelle ist ein rechteckiger Bereich - optional umrahmt - der Text enthalten kann. Sie wird an der jeweils aktuellen Schreibposition gerendert. Wir k\u00f6nnen die Abmessungen der Zelle, den Text und dessen Formatierung (zentriert oder ausgerichtet), einen ggf. gew\u00fcnschten Rahmen und die Festlegung der neuen Schreibposition nach dem Schreiben der Zelle (rechts, unten oder am Anfang der n\u00e4chsten Zeile) bestimmen. Um einen Rahmen hinzuzuf\u00fcgen, w\u00fcrden wir die Methode folgenderma\u00dfen einbinden: pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , 'Hello World!' , 1 ) Um eine neue Zelle mit zentriertem Text hinzuzuf\u00fcgen und anschlie\u00dfend in die n\u00e4chste Zeile zu springen, k\u00f6nnen wir Folgendes schreiben: pdf . cell ( 60 , 10 , 'Powered by FPDF.' , ln = 1 , align = 'C' ) Anmerkung : Der Zeilenumbruch kann auch mit ln erfolgen. Diese Methode erlaubt es, zus\u00e4tzlich die H\u00f6he des Umbruchs anzugeben. Schlie\u00dflich wird das Dokument mit output geschlossen und unter dem angegebenen Dateipfad gespeichert.

Sie werden jeweils automatisch aufgerufen. Die Methode 'header' direkt nach dem Hinzug\u00fcgen einer neuen Seite, die Methode 'footer' wenn die Bearbeitung einer Seite durch das Hinzuf\u00fcgen einer weiteren Seite oder das Abspeichern des Dokuments abgeschlossen wird. Die Methoden existieren bereits in der Klasse FPDF, sind aber leer. Um sie zu nutzen, m\u00fcssen wir die Klasse erweitern und sie \u00fcberschreiben. Das Logo wird mit der Methode image eingebunden, und auf der Seite durch die Angabe der Position der linken oberen Ecke und die gew\u00fcnschte Bildbreite platziert. Die H\u00f6he wird automatisch berechnet, um die Proportionen des Bildes zu erhalten. Um die Seitenzahl einzuf\u00fcgenn, \u00fcbergeben wir zuerst der Zelle einen Nullwert als Breite der Zelle. Das bedeutet, dass die Zelle bis zum rechten Rand der Seite reichen soll. Das ist besonders praktisch, um Text zu zentrieren. Die aktuelle Seitenzahl wird durch die Methode page_no ermittelt und in die Zelle geschrieben. Die Gesamtseitenzahl wird mit Hilfe des speziellen Platzhalterwertes {nb} ermittelt, der beim Schlie\u00dfen des Dokuments ersetzt wird (vorausgesetzt, du hast vorher alias_nb_pages ) aufgerufen. Beachte die Verwendung der Methode set_y , mit der du die vertikale Schreibposition an einer absoluten Stelle der Seite - von oben oder von unten aus - setzen kannst. Eine weitere interessante Funktion wird hier ebenfalls verwendet: der automatische Seitenumbruch. Sobald eine Zelle eine festgelegte Grenze in der Seite \u00fcberschreitet (standardm\u00e4\u00dfig 2 Zentimeter vom unteren Rand), wird ein Seitenumbruch durchgef\u00fchrt und die Einstellungen der gewahlten Schrift auf der n\u00e4chsten Seite automatisch beibehalten. Obwohl die Kopf- und Fu\u00dfzeilen ihre eigene Schriftart ( Helvetica ) w\u00e4hlen, wird im Textk\u00f6rper Times verwendet. Dieser Mechanismus der automatischen \u00dcbernahme der Einstellungen nach Seitenumbruch gilt auch f\u00fcr Farben und Zeilenbreite. Der Grenzwert, der den Seitenumbruch ausl\u00f6st, kann mit set_auto_page_break festgelegt werden .","title":"Lektion 2 - Kopfzeile, Fu\u00dfzeile, Seitenumbruch und Bild"},{"location":"Tutorial-de.html#lektion-3-zeilenumbruche-und-farben","text":"Fahren wir mit einem Beispiel fort, das Abs\u00e4tze im Blocksatz ausgibt.

Das erste Beispiel wird auf die einfachste Art und Weise realisiert. Einfach gerahmte Zellen, die alle die gleiche Gr\u00f6\u00dfe haben und linksb\u00fcndig ausgerichtet sind. Das Ergebnis ist rudiment\u00e4r, aber sehr schnell zu erzielen. Die zweite Tabelle bringt einige Verbesserungen: Jede Spalte hat ihre eigene Breite, die \u00dcberschriften sind zentriert und die Zahlen rechtsb\u00fcndig ausgerichtet. Au\u00dferdem wurden die horizontalen Linien entfernt. Dies geschieht mit Hilfe des Randparameters der Methode cell() , der angibt, welche Seiten der Zelle gezeichnet werden m\u00fcssen. Im Beispiel w\u00e4hlen wir die linke (L) und die rechte (R) Seite. Jetzt muss nur noch das Problem der horizontalen Linie zum Abschluss der Tabelle gel\u00f6st werden. Es gibt zwei M\u00f6glichkeiten, es zu l\u00f6sen: In der Schleife pr\u00fcfen, ob wir uns in der letzten Zeile befinden und dann \"LRB\" als Rahmenparameter \u00fcbergeben oder, wie hier geschehen, eine abschlie\u00dfende Zelle separat nach dem Durchlaufen der Schleife einf\u00fcgen.

Der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Nachteil ist jedoch, dass die von multi_cell() bekannte M\u00f6glichkeit zur Festlegung der Textausrichtung fehlt. Auf der ersten Seite des Beispiels nutzen wir write() . Der Anfang des Satzes wird in \"normalem\" Stil geschrieben, dann mit der Methode set_font() auf Unterstreichung umgestellt und der Satz beendet.

Um einen externen Link mit Hilfe eines Bildes zu erstellen, verwenden wir image() . Es besteht die M\u00f6glichkeit, der Methode ein Linkziel als eines ihrer Argumente zu \u00fcbergeben. Der Link kann sowohl einer interner als auch ein externer sein. Eine weitere M\u00f6glichkeit, den Schriftstil zu \u00e4ndern und Links hinzuzuf\u00fcgen, stellt die Verwendung der Methode write_html() dar.

Le constructeur FPDF est utilis\u00e9 avec ses valeurs par d\u00e9faut : les pages sont en format portrait A4 et l'unit\u00e9 de mesure est le millim\u00e8tre. Cela peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre sp\u00e9fici\u00e9 de cette mani\u00e8re : pdf = FPDF ( orientation = \"P\" , unit = \"mm\" , format = \"A4\" ) Il est possible de cr\u00e9er un PDF en format paysage ( L ) ou encore d'utiliser d'autres formats (par exemple Letter et Legal ) et unit\u00e9s de mesure ( pt , cm , in ). Il n'y a pas encore de page, il faut donc en cr\u00e9er une avec add_page . Le coin en haut \u00e0 gauche correspond \u00e0 l'origine, et le curseur (c'est-\u00e0-dire la position actuelle o\u00f9 l'on va afficher un \u00e9l\u00e9ment) est plac\u00e9 par d\u00e9faut \u00e0 1 cm des bords; les marges peuvent \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es avec set_margins . Avant de pouvoir afficher du texte, il faut obligatoirement choisir une police de caract\u00e8res avec set_font . Choisissons Helvetica bold 16: pdf . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'B' , 16 ) On aurait pu sp\u00e9cifier une police en italique avec I ; soulign\u00e9e avec U ou une police normale avec une chaine de caract\u00e8res vide. Il est aussi possible de combiner les effets en combinant les caract\u00e8res. Notez que la taille des caract\u00e8res est \u00e0 sp\u00e9cifier en points (pts), pas en millim\u00e8tres (ou tout autre unit\u00e9); c'est la seule exception. Les autres polices fournies par d\u00e9faut sont Times , Courier , Symbol et ZapfDingbats . On peut maintenant afficher une cellule avec cell . Une cellule est une zone rectangulaire, avec ou sans cadre, qui contient du texte. Elle est affich\u00e9e \u00e0 la position actuelle du curseur. On sp\u00e9cifie ses dimensions, le texte (centr\u00e9 ou align\u00e9), si'l y a une bordure ou non, ainsi que la position du curseur apr\u00e8s avoir affich\u00e9 la cellule (s'il se d\u00e9place \u00e0 droite, vers le bas ou au d\u00e9but de la ligne suivante). Pour ajouter un cadre, on utilise ceci : pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , 'Hello World!' , 1 ) Pour ajouter une nouvelle cellule avec un texte centr\u00e9, et d\u00e9placer le curseur \u00e0 la ligne suivante on utilise cela : pdf . cell ( 60 , 10 , 'Powered by FPDF.' , ln = 1 , align = 'C' ) Remarque : le saut de ligne peut aussi \u00eatre fait avec ln . Cette m\u00e9thode permet de sp\u00e9cifier la hauteur du saut. Enfin, le document est sauvegard\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 en utilisant output . Sans aucun param\u00e8tre, output() retourne le buffer bytearray du PDF. Tuto 2 - En-t\u00eate, bas de page, saut de page et image Voici un exemple contenant deux pages avec un en-t\u00eate, un bas de page et un logo : from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def header ( self ): # Rendering logo: self . image ( \"../docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , 10 , 8 , 33 ) # Setting font: helvetica bold 15 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) # Moving cursor to the right: self . cell ( 80 ) # Printing title: self . cell ( 30 , 10 , \"Title\" , 1 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 20 ) def footer ( self ): # Position cursor at 1.5 cm from bottom: self . set_y ( - 15 ) # Setting font: helvetica italic 8 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) # Printing page number: self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } / {{ nb }} \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Instantiation of inherited class pdf = PDF () pdf . alias_nb_pages () pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) for i in range ( 1 , 41 ): pdf . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Printing line number { i } \" , 0 , 1 ) pdf . output ( \"tuto2.pdf\" ) PDF g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 Cet exemple utilise les m\u00e9thodes header et footer pour g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des en-t\u00eates et des bas de page. Elles sont appel\u00e9es automatiquement. Elles existent d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans la classe FPDF mais elles ne font rien, il faut donc les red\u00e9finir dans une classe fille. Le logo est affich\u00e9 avec la m\u00e9thode image en sp\u00e9cifiant la position du coin sup\u00e9rieur gauche et la largeur de l'image. La hauteur est calcul\u00e9e automatiquement pour garder les proportions de l'image. Pour centrer le num\u00e9ro de page dans le bas de page, il faut passer la valeur nulle \u00e0 la place de la largeur de la cellule. Cela fait prendre toute la largeur de la page \u00e0 la cellule, ce qui permet de centrer le texte. Le num\u00e9ro de page actuel est obtenu avec la m\u00e9thode page_no ; le nombre total de pages est obtenu avec la variable {nb} qui prend sa valeur quand le document est ferm\u00e9 (la m\u00e9thode alias_nb_pages permet de d\u00e9finir un autre nom de variable pour cette valeur). La m\u00e9thode set_y permet de sp\u00e9cifier une position dans la page relative au haut ou pas de page. Une autre fonctionnalit\u00e9 int\u00e9ressante est utilis\u00e9e ici : les sauts de page automatiques. Si une cellule d\u00e9passe la limite du contenu de la page (par d\u00e9faut \u00e0 2 centim\u00e8tres du bas), un saut de page est ins\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la place et la police de caract\u00e8res est restaur\u00e9e.

Le constructeur FPDF est utilis\u00e9 avec ses valeurs par d\u00e9faut : les pages sont en format portrait A4 et l'unit\u00e9 de mesure est le millim\u00e8tre. Cela peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre sp\u00e9fici\u00e9 de cette mani\u00e8re : pdf = FPDF ( orientation = \"P\" , unit = \"mm\" , format = \"A4\" ) Il est possible de cr\u00e9er un PDF en format paysage ( L ) ou encore d'utiliser d'autres formats (par exemple Letter et Legal ) et unit\u00e9s de mesure ( pt , cm , in ). Il n'y a pas encore de page, il faut donc en cr\u00e9er une avec add_page . Le coin en haut \u00e0 gauche correspond \u00e0 l'origine, et le curseur (c'est-\u00e0-dire la position actuelle o\u00f9 l'on va afficher un \u00e9l\u00e9ment) est plac\u00e9 par d\u00e9faut \u00e0 1 cm des bords; les marges peuvent \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es avec set_margins . Avant de pouvoir afficher du texte, il faut obligatoirement choisir une police de caract\u00e8res avec set_font . Choisissons Helvetica bold 16: pdf . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'B' , 16 ) On aurait pu sp\u00e9cifier une police en italique avec I ; soulign\u00e9e avec U ou une police normale avec une chaine de caract\u00e8res vide. Il est aussi possible de combiner les effets en combinant les caract\u00e8res. Notez que la taille des caract\u00e8res est \u00e0 sp\u00e9cifier en points (pts), pas en millim\u00e8tres (ou tout autre unit\u00e9); c'est la seule exception. Les autres polices fournies par d\u00e9faut sont Times , Courier , Symbol et ZapfDingbats . On peut maintenant afficher une cellule avec cell . Une cellule est une zone rectangulaire, avec ou sans cadre, qui contient du texte. Elle est affich\u00e9e \u00e0 la position actuelle du curseur. On sp\u00e9cifie ses dimensions, le texte (centr\u00e9 ou align\u00e9), si'l y a une bordure ou non, ainsi que la position du curseur apr\u00e8s avoir affich\u00e9 la cellule (s'il se d\u00e9place \u00e0 droite, vers le bas ou au d\u00e9but de la ligne suivante). Pour ajouter un cadre, on utilise ceci : pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , 'Hello World!' , 1 ) Pour ajouter une nouvelle cellule avec un texte centr\u00e9, et d\u00e9placer le curseur \u00e0 la ligne suivante on utilise cela : pdf . cell ( 60 , 10 , 'Powered by FPDF.' , ln = 1 , align = 'C' ) Remarque : le saut de ligne peut aussi \u00eatre fait avec ln . Cette m\u00e9thode permet de sp\u00e9cifier la hauteur du saut. Enfin, le document est sauvegard\u00e9 \u00e0 l'endroit sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 en utilisant output .

La hauteur est calcul\u00e9e automatiquement pour garder les proportions de l'image. Pour centrer le num\u00e9ro de page dans le bas de page, il faut passer la valeur nulle \u00e0 la place de la largeur de la cellule. Cela fait prendre toute la largeur de la page \u00e0 la cellule, ce qui permet de centrer le texte. Le num\u00e9ro de page actuel est obtenu avec la m\u00e9thode page_no ; le nombre total de pages est obtenu avec la variable {nb} qui prend sa valeur quand le document est ferm\u00e9 (la m\u00e9thode alias_nb_pages permet de d\u00e9finir un autre nom de variable pour cette valeur). La m\u00e9thode set_y permet de sp\u00e9cifier une position dans la page relative au haut ou pas de page. Une autre fonctionnalit\u00e9 int\u00e9ressante est utilis\u00e9e ici : les sauts de page automatiques.

Cos\u00ec facendo il costruttore FPDF viene utilizzato con i suoi valori di default: le pagine sono in A4 verticale e l'unit\u00e0 di misura \u00e8 millimetri. Avremmo potuto specificarle esplicitamente facendo: pdf = FPDF ( orientation = \"P\" , unit = \"mm\" , format = \"A4\" ) \u00c8 possibile impostare il PDF in modalit\u00e0 orizzontale ( L ) o utilizzare altri formati (come Letter e Legal ) e unit\u00e0 di misura ( pt , cm , in ). Non esiste una pagina al momento, quindi dobbiamo aggiungerne una con add_page . L'origine \u00e8 in alto a sinistra e la posizione corrente \u00e8 a 1cm dai bordi; i margini possono essere cambiati con set_margins . Prima di poter stampare del testo, \u00e8 obbligatorio selezionare un font con set_font , altrimenti il documento risulterebbe non valido. Scegliamo Helvetica bold 16: pdf . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'B' , 16 ) Avremmo potuto scegliere il corsivo con I , sottolineato con U o un font regolare lasciando la stringa vuota (o ogni combinazione). Notare che la dimensione dei caratteri \u00e8 specificata in punti, non millimetri (o altre unit\u00e0 di misura); questa \u00e8 l'unica eccezione. Gli altri font disponibili sono Times , Courier , Symbol and ZapfDingbats . Adesso possiamo disegnare una cella con cell . Una cella \u00e8 un'area rettangolare, in caso con bordo, che contiene del testo. \u00c8 disegnata nella attuale posizione. Specifichiamo le sue dimensioni, il suo testo (centrato o allineato), se i bordi devono essere mostrati, e dove verr\u00e0 spostata la posizione quando avremo finito (a destra, sotto, o all'inizio della riga successiva). Faremmo cos\u00ec: pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , 'Hello World!' , 1 ) Per aggiungere una nuova cella di fianco alla precedente con testo centrato e poi spostarci alla riga successiva, faremmo: pdf . cell ( 60 , 10 , 'Powered by FPDF.' , ln = 1 , align = 'C' ) NB : si pu\u00f2 andare a capo anche con ln . Questo metodo permette di specificare l'altezza dello spazio. In fine, il documento \u00e8 chiuso e salvato nella destinazione fornita attraverso output . Senza alcun parametro, output() ritorna il PDF in un buffer bytearray . Tuto 2 - Intestazione, pi\u00e8 di pagina, interruzione di pagina ed immagini Ecco un esempio composto da due pagine con intestazione, pi\u00e8 di pagina e logo: from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def header ( self ): # Rendering logo: self . image ( \"../docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , 10 , 8 , 33 ) # Setting font: helvetica bold 15 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) # Moving cursor to the right: self . cell ( 80 ) # Printing title: self . cell ( 30 , 10 , \"Title\" , 1 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 20 ) def footer ( self ): # Position cursor at 1.5 cm from bottom: self . set_y ( - 15 ) # Setting font: helvetica italic 8 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) # Printing page number: self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } / {{ nb }} \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Instantiation of inherited class pdf = PDF () pdf . alias_nb_pages () pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) for i in range ( 1 , 41 ): pdf . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Printing line number { i } \" , 0 , 1 ) pdf . output ( \"tuto2.pdf\" ) Risultato PDF Questo esempio sfrutta i metodi header e footer per processare intestazioni e pi\u00e8 di pagina. Vengono chiamati automaticamente. Esistono nella classe FPDF ma non eseguono operazioni, quindi \u00e8 necessario estendere la classe e sovrascriverli. Il logo \u00e8 stampato con il metodo image specificando la posizione del suo angolo in alto a sinistra e la sua larghezza. L'altezza \u00e8 calcolata automaticamente per rispettare le proporzioni dell'immagine. Per stampare il numero della pagina, un valore nullo pu\u00f2 essere passato come larghezza della cella. Significa che la cella \"crescer\u00e0\" fino al margine destro della pagina; \u00e8 utile per centrare il testo. Il numero di pagina \u00e8 ritornato da page_no ; mentre per il numero totale di pagine, si ottiene attraverso il valore speciale {nb} che verr\u00e0 sostituito quando le pagine saranno generate (assumendo che alias_nb_pages venga chiamato). Importante menzionare il metodo set_y che permette di selezionare una posizione assoluta all'interno della pagina, incominciando dall'alto o dal basso. Un'altra feature interessante: l'interruzione di pagina automatica. Non appena una cella dovesse superare il limite nella pagina (a 2 centimetri dal fondo di default), ci sarebbe un'interruzione e un reset del font. Nonostante l'intestazione e il pi\u00e8 di pagina scelgano il proprio font ( helvetica ), il contenuto continua in Times .

Successivamente selezioniamo i colori (utilizzando set_draw_color , set_fill_color e set_text_color ) e aumentiamo la larghezza della linea a 1mm (invece dei 0.2 di default) con set_line_width . In fine, stampiamo la cella (l'ultimo parametro a true indica che lo sfondo dovr\u00e0 essere riempito). Il metodo utilizzato per stampare i paragrafi \u00e8 multi_cell . Ogni volta che una linea raggiunge l'estremit\u00e0 destra della cella o c'\u00e8 un carattere carriage return, avremo un'interruzione di linea e una nuova cella verr\u00e0 automaticamente creata.

Usando accept_page_break , una volta che la cella oltrepasser\u00e0 il limite basso della pagina, il numero della colonna corrente verr\u00e0 controllato. Se sar\u00e0 meno di 2 (abbiamo deciso di dividere la pagina in 3 colonne) chiamer\u00e0 il metodo set_cal, incrementando il numero della colonna e modificando la posizione della prossima colonna in modo e il testo continui l\u00ec. Una volta che il limite inferiore della terza colonna sar\u00e0 raggiunto, accept_page_break resetter\u00e0 e andr\u00e0 alla prima colonna provocando una interruzione di pagina. Tuto 5 - Creare tabelle Questo tutoria spiegher\u00e0 come creare facilmente tabelle. Creeremo tre diverse tabelle per spiegare cosa si pu\u00f2 ottenere con piccolo cambiamenti. import csv from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def basic_table ( self , headings , rows ): for heading in headings : self . cell ( 40 , 7 , heading , 1 ) self . ln () for row in rows : for col in row : self . cell ( 40 , 6 , col , 1 ) self . ln () def improved_table ( self , headings , rows , col_widths = ( 42 , 39 , 35 , 40 )): for col_width , heading in zip ( col_widths , headings ): self . cell ( col_width , 7 , heading , 1 , 0 , \"C\" ) self . ln () for row in rows : self . cell ( col_widths [ 0 ], 6 , row [ 0 ], \"LR\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 1 ], 6 , row [ 1 ], \"LR\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 2 ], 6 , row [ 2 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 3 ], 6 , row [ 3 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" ) self . ln () # Closure line: self . cell ( sum ( col_widths ), 0 , \"\" , \"T\" ) def colored_table ( self , headings , rows , col_widths = ( 42 , 39 , 35 , 42 )): # Colors, line width and bold font: self . set_fill_color ( 255 , 100 , 0 ) self . set_text_color ( 255 ) self . set_draw_color ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) self . set_line_width ( 0.3 ) self . set_font ( style = \"B\" ) for col_width , heading in zip ( col_widths , headings ): self . cell ( col_width , 7 , heading , 1 , 0 , \"C\" , True ) self . ln () # Color and font restoration: self . set_fill_color ( 224 , 235 , 255 ) self . set_text_color ( 0 ) self . set_font () fill = False for row in rows : self . cell ( col_widths [ 0 ], 6 , row [ 0 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"L\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 1 ], 6 , row [ 1 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"L\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 2 ], 6 , row [ 2 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 3 ], 6 , row [ 3 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" , fill ) self . ln () fill = not fill self . cell ( sum ( col_widths ), 0 , \"\" , \"T\" ) def load_data_from_csv ( csv_filepath ): headings , rows = [], [] with open ( csv_filepath , encoding = \"utf8\" ) as csv_file : for row in csv . reader ( csv_file , delimiter = \",\" ): if not headings : # extracting column names from first row: headings = row else : rows . append ( row ) return headings , rows col_names , data = load_data_from_csv ( \"countries.txt\" ) pdf = PDF () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , size = 14 ) pdf . add_page () pdf . basic_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . add_page () pdf . improved_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . add_page () pdf . colored_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . output ( \"tuto5.pdf\" ) Risultato PDF - Testo delle nazioni Dato che una tabella \u00e8 un insieme di celle, viene natura crearne una partendo da loro. Il primo esempio \u00e8 la via pi\u00f9 elementare: semplici celle con cornice, tutte della stessa dimensione e allineate a sinistra. Il risultato \u00e8 rudimentale ma molto veloce da ottenere. La seconda tabella contiene dei miglioramenti: ogni colonna ha la propria larghezza, i titoli sono centrati e i numeri allineati a destra. Inoltre, le linee orizzontale sono state rimosse. Questo \u00e8 stato possibile grazie al parametro border del metodo Cell(), che specifica quali lati della cella saranno disegnati. In questo caso vogliamo il sinistro (L) e il destro (R). Rimane il problema delle linee orizzontali. Ci sono due possibilit\u00e0 per risolverlo: controllare di essere nell'ultimo giro del ciclo, nel qual caso utilizziamo LRB per il parametro border; oppure, come fatto in questo esempio, aggiungiamo una linea dopo il completamento del ciclo. La terza tabella \u00e8 molto simile alla seconda, ma utilizza i colori. Il colore di sfondo, testo e linee sono semplicemente specificati. L'alternanza dei colori delle righe \u00e8 ottenuta utilizzando celle con sfondo colorato e trasparente alternativamente. Tuto 6 - Creare link e mescolare stili di testo Questo tutorial spiegher\u00e0 molti modi di inserire link interni al pdf, e come inserirne a sorgenti esterne. Saranno mostrati anche molti modi di utilizzare diversi stili di testo (grassetto, corsivo e sottolineato) nello stesso testo. from fpdf import FPDF , HTMLMixin class MyFPDF ( FPDF , HTMLMixin ): pass pdf = MyFPDF () # First page: pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , size = 20 ) pdf . write ( 5 , \"To find out what's new in self tutorial, click \" ) pdf . set_font ( style = \"U\" ) link = pdf . add_link () pdf . write ( 5 , \"here\" , link ) pdf . set_font () # Second page: pdf . add_page () pdf . set_link ( link ) pdf . image ( \"../docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , 10 , 10 , 50 , 0 , \"\" , \"https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/\" ) pdf . set_left_margin ( 60 ) pdf . set_font_size ( 18 ) pdf . write_html ( \"\"\"You can print text mixing different styles using HTML tags: <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underlined</u>, or <b><i><u>all at once</u></i></b>! <br><br>You can also insert links on text, such as <a href=\"https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/\">https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/</a>, or on an image: the logo is clickable!\"\"\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto6.pdf\" ) Risultato PDF - fpdf2-logo Il nuovo metodo qui utilizzato per stampare testo \u00e8 write() . \u00c8 molto simile a multi_cell() , ma con delle differenze: La fine della linea \u00e8 al margine destro e la linea successiva inizia al margine sinistro. La posizione attuale si sposta alla fine del testo stampato. Il metodo quindi ci permette di scrivere un blocco di testo, cambiare lo stile del testo, e continuare a scrivere esattamente da dove eravamo rimasti. D'altro canto, il suo peggior svantaggio \u00e8 che non possiamo giustificare il testo come con multi_cell() method. Nella prima pagina dell'esempio, abbiamo usato write() per questo scopo. L'inizio della frase \u00e8 scritta in font normale, poi utilizzando set_font() siamo passati al sottolineato e abbiamo finito la frase. Per aggiungere un link interno che puntasse alla seconda pagina, abbiamo utilizzato add_link() che crea un area cliccabile che abbiamo chiamato \"link\" che redirige ad un altro punto del documento. Nella seconda pagina abbiamo usato set_link() per definire un'area di destinazione per il link creato in precedenza. Per creare un link esterno utilizzando un'immagine, abbiamo usato image() . Il metodo ha l'opzione di passare un link come argomento. Il link pu\u00f2 essere sia interno che esterno. In alternativa, un'altra opzione per cambiare lo stile e aggiungere link \u00e8 di utilizzare write_html() . \u00c8 un parser hrml che permette di aggiungere testo, cambiare stile e aggiungere link utilizzando html.","title":"Tutorial #"},{"location":"Tutorial-it.html#tutorial","text":"English version: Tutorial Version en fran\u00e7ais : Tutorial-fr Deutsche Version: Tutorial-de Versi\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol: Tutorial-es \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0930\u0923: Tutorial-\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 Vers\u00e3o em portugu\u00eas: Tutorial-pt \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c: Tutorial-ru Documentazione completa dei metodi: fpdf.FPDF API doc Tutorial Tuto 1 - Esempio base Tuto 2 - Intestazione, pi\u00e8 di pagina, interruzione di pagina ed immagini Tuto 3 - Interruzioni di riga e colori Tuto 4 - Colonne multiple Tuto 5 - Creare tabelle Tuto 6 - Creare link e mescolare stili di testo","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"Tutorial-it.html#tuto-1-esempio-base","text":"Iniziamo con un esempio comune: from fpdf import FPDF pdf = FPDF () pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 16 ) pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , \"Hello World!\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto1.pdf\" ) Risultato PDF Dopo aver incluso la libreria, creiamo un oggetto FPDF . Cos\u00ec facendo il costruttore FPDF viene utilizzato con i suoi valori di default: le pagine sono in A4 verticale e l'unit\u00e0 di misura \u00e8 millimetri.

Non esiste una pagina al momento, quindi dobbiamo aggiungerne una con add_page . L'origine \u00e8 in alto a sinistra e la posizione corrente \u00e8 a 1cm dai bordi; i margini possono essere cambiati con set_margins . Prima di poter stampare del testo, \u00e8 obbligatorio selezionare un font con set_font , altrimenti il documento risulterebbe non valido. Scegliamo Helvetica bold 16: pdf . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'B' , 16 ) Avremmo potuto scegliere il corsivo con I , sottolineato con U o un font regolare lasciando la stringa vuota (o ogni combinazione). Notare che la dimensione dei caratteri \u00e8 specificata in punti, non millimetri (o altre unit\u00e0 di misura); questa \u00e8 l'unica eccezione. Gli altri font disponibili sono Times , Courier , Symbol and ZapfDingbats . Adesso possiamo disegnare una cella con cell . Una cella \u00e8 un'area rettangolare, in caso con bordo, che contiene del testo. \u00c8 disegnata nella attuale posizione. Specifichiamo le sue dimensioni, il suo testo (centrato o allineato), se i bordi devono essere mostrati, e dove verr\u00e0 spostata la posizione quando avremo finito (a destra, sotto, o all'inizio della riga successiva). Faremmo cos\u00ec: pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , 'Hello World!' , 1 ) Per aggiungere una nuova cella di fianco alla precedente con testo centrato e poi spostarci alla riga successiva, faremmo: pdf . cell ( 60 , 10 , 'Powered by FPDF.' , ln = 1 , align = 'C' ) NB : si pu\u00f2 andare a capo anche con ln .

Vengono chiamati automaticamente. Esistono nella classe FPDF ma non eseguono operazioni, quindi \u00e8 necessario estendere la classe e sovrascriverli. Il logo \u00e8 stampato con il metodo image specificando la posizione del suo angolo in alto a sinistra e la sua larghezza. L'altezza \u00e8 calcolata automaticamente per rispettare le proporzioni dell'immagine. Per stampare il numero della pagina, un valore nullo pu\u00f2 essere passato come larghezza della cella. Significa che la cella \"crescer\u00e0\" fino al margine destro della pagina; \u00e8 utile per centrare il testo. Il numero di pagina \u00e8 ritornato da page_no ; mentre per il numero totale di pagine, si ottiene attraverso il valore speciale {nb} che verr\u00e0 sostituito quando le pagine saranno generate (assumendo che alias_nb_pages venga chiamato). Importante menzionare il metodo set_y che permette di selezionare una posizione assoluta all'interno della pagina, incominciando dall'alto o dal basso. Un'altra feature interessante: l'interruzione di pagina automatica. Non appena una cella dovesse superare il limite nella pagina (a 2 centimetri dal fondo di default), ci sarebbe un'interruzione e un reset del font. Nonostante l'intestazione e il pi\u00e8 di pagina scelgano il proprio font ( helvetica ), il contenuto continua in Times . Questo meccanismo di reset automatico si applica anche ai colori e allo spessore della linea.

Il primo esempio \u00e8 la via pi\u00f9 elementare: semplici celle con cornice, tutte della stessa dimensione e allineate a sinistra. Il risultato \u00e8 rudimentale ma molto veloce da ottenere. La seconda tabella contiene dei miglioramenti: ogni colonna ha la propria larghezza, i titoli sono centrati e i numeri allineati a destra. Inoltre, le linee orizzontale sono state rimosse. Questo \u00e8 stato possibile grazie al parametro border del metodo Cell(), che specifica quali lati della cella saranno disegnati. In questo caso vogliamo il sinistro (L) e il destro (R). Rimane il problema delle linee orizzontali. Ci sono due possibilit\u00e0 per risolverlo: controllare di essere nell'ultimo giro del ciclo, nel qual caso utilizziamo LRB per il parametro border; oppure, come fatto in questo esempio, aggiungiamo una linea dopo il completamento del ciclo. La terza tabella \u00e8 molto simile alla seconda, ma utilizza i colori. Il colore di sfondo, testo e linee sono semplicemente specificati. L'alternanza dei colori delle righe \u00e8 ottenuta utilizzando celle con sfondo colorato e trasparente alternativamente.","title":"Tuto 5 - Creare tabelle"},{"location":"Tutorial-it.html#tuto-6-creare-link-e-mescolare-stili-di-testo","text":"Questo tutorial spiegher\u00e0 molti modi di inserire link interni al pdf, e come inserirne a sorgenti esterne.

La posizione attuale si sposta alla fine del testo stampato.

D'altro canto, il suo peggior svantaggio \u00e8 che non possiamo giustificare il testo come con multi_cell() method. Nella prima pagina dell'esempio, abbiamo usato write() per questo scopo. L'inizio della frase \u00e8 scritta in font normale, poi utilizzando set_font() siamo passati al sottolineato e abbiamo finito la frase. Per aggiungere un link interno che puntasse alla seconda pagina, abbiamo utilizzato add_link() che crea un area cliccabile che abbiamo chiamato \"link\" che redirige ad un altro punto del documento. Nella seconda pagina abbiamo usato set_link() per definire un'area di destinazione per il link creato in precedenza. Per creare un link esterno utilizzando un'immagine, abbiamo usato image() . Il metodo ha l'opzione di passare un link come argomento. Il link pu\u00f2 essere sia interno che esterno. In alternativa, un'altra opzione per cambiare lo stile e aggiungere link \u00e8 di utilizzare write_html() . \u00c8 un parser hrml che permette di aggiungere testo, cambiare stile e aggiungere link utilizzando html.","title":"Tuto 6 - Creare link e mescolare stili di testo"},{"location":"Tutorial-pt.html","text":"Tutorial English version: Tutorial Version en fran\u00e7ais : Tutorial-fr Deutsche Version: Tutorial-de Versi\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol: Tutorial-es \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0930\u0923: Tutorial-\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 Versione in italiano: Tutorial-it \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c: Tutorial-ru Methods full documentation: fpdf.FPDF API doc Tutorial Tuto 1 - Exemplo M\u00ednimo Tuto 2 - Cabe\u00e7alho, rodap\u00e9, quebra de p\u00e1gina e imagem Tuto 3 - Quebras de linha e cores Tuto 4 - Multi Colunas Tuto 5 - Criar Tabelas Tuto 6 - Criar links e misturar estilos de texto Tuto 1 - Exemplo M\u00ednimo Vamos come\u00e7ar com um exemplo cl\u00e1ssico: from fpdf import FPDF pdf = FPDF () pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 16 ) pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , \"Hello World!\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto1.pdf\" ) PDF resultante Ap\u00f3s incluirmos o ficheiro da biblioteca, criamos um objeto FPDF .

Antes de imprimirmos o texto, \u00e9 obrigat\u00f3rio selecionar uma fonte com set_font , caso contr\u00e1rio, o documento ser\u00e1 inv\u00e1lido. N\u00f3s escolhemos Helvetica bold 16: pdf . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'B' , 16 ) Podemos formatar em it\u00e1lico com I , sublinhar com U ou uma fonte normal com uma string vazia (ou qualquer combina\u00e7\u00e3o).

As outras fontes integradas s\u00e3o Times , Courier , Symbol e ZapfDingbats . Agora podemos imprimir uma c\u00e9lula com cell . Uma c\u00e9lula \u00e9 uma \u00e1rea retangular, possivelmente emoldurada, que cont\u00e9m algum texto. \u00c9 renderizado na posi\u00e7\u00e3o atual. N\u00f3s especificamos as suas dimens\u00f5es, o seu texto (centrado ou alinhado), se as bordas devem ser desenhadas, e para onde a posi\u00e7\u00e3o atual se deve mover depois desta altera\u00e7\u00e3o (para a direita, abaixo ou no in\u00edcio da pr\u00f3xima linha). Para adicionar uma moldura, temos de fazer o seguinte: pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , 'Hello World!' , 1 ) Para adicionar uma nova c\u00e9lula ao lado desta, com texto centralizado e ir para a pr\u00f3xima linha, ter\u00edamos de fazer: pdf . cell ( 60 , 10 , 'Powered by FPDF.' , ln = 1 , align = 'C' ) Nota : a quebra de linha tamb\u00e9m pode ser feita com ln . Esse m\u00e9todo permite especificar, adicionalmente, a altura da quebra. Finalmente, o documento \u00e9 fechado e guardado no caminho do arquivo fornecido utilizando output .

Tuto 2 - Cabe\u00e7alho, rodap\u00e9, quebra de p\u00e1gina e imagem Aqui temos um exemplo de duas p\u00e1ginas com cabe\u00e7alho, rodap\u00e9 e log\u00f3tipo: from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def header ( self ): # Rendering logo: self . image ( \"../docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , 10 , 8 , 33 ) # Setting font: helvetica bold 15 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) # Moving cursor to the right: self . cell ( 80 ) # Printing title: self . cell ( 30 , 10 , \"Title\" , 1 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 20 ) def footer ( self ): # Position cursor at 1.5 cm from bottom: self . set_y ( - 15 ) # Setting font: helvetica italic 8 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) # Printing page number: self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } / {{ nb }} \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Instantiation of inherited class pdf = PDF () pdf . alias_nb_pages () pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) for i in range ( 1 , 41 ): pdf . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Printing line number { i } \" , 0 , 1 ) pdf . output ( \"tuto2.pdf\" ) PDF resultante Este exemplo usa os header e o footer para processar cabe\u00e7alhos e rodap\u00e9s de p\u00e1gina. Estes s\u00e3o chamados automaticamente. Eles j\u00e1 existem na classe FPDF, mas n\u00e3o fazem nada, portanto, temos que os estender a classe e substitu\u00ed-los. O log\u00f3tipo \u00e9 impresso utilizando o m\u00e9todo image , especificando o seu canto superior esquerdo e sua largura. A altura \u00e9 calculada automaticamente para respeitar as propor\u00e7\u00f5es da imagem. Para imprimir o n\u00famero da p\u00e1gina, um valor nulo \u00e9 passado como a largura da c\u00e9lula. Isso significa que a c\u00e9lula deve se estender at\u00e9 a margem direita da p\u00e1gina; \u00e9 \u00fatil para centralizar texto. O n\u00famero da p\u00e1gina atual \u00e9 retornado pelo m\u00e9todo page_no ; quanto ao n\u00famero total de p\u00e1ginas, \u00e9 obtido por meio do valor especial {nb} que ser\u00e1 substitu\u00eddo quando se fecha o documento (desde que use primeiro o alias_nb_pages ). Observe que o uso do m\u00e9todo set_y permite definir a posi\u00e7\u00e3o em um local absoluto da p\u00e1gina, come\u00e7ando do in\u00edcio ou do fim. Outro recurso interessante que se usa aqui \u00e9 a quebra de p\u00e1gina autom\u00e1tica. Desde do momento em que uma c\u00e9lula cruza o limite da p\u00e1gina (a 2 cent\u00edmetros da parte inferior por padr\u00e3o), uma pausa \u00e9 executada e a fonte restaurada. Embora o cabe\u00e7alho e rodap\u00e9s selecionam a sua pr\u00f3pria fonte ( helvetica ), o corpo continua com Times . Este mecanismo de restaura\u00e7\u00e3o autom\u00e1tica tamb\u00e9m se aplica a cores e largura de linha. O limite que dispara quebras de p\u00e1gina pode ser definido com set_auto_page_break . Tuto 3 - Quebras de linha e cores Vamos continuar com um exemplo que imprime par\u00e1grafos justificados e o uso de cores. from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def header ( self ): # Setting font: helvetica bold 15 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) # Calculating width of title and setting cursor position: width = self . get_string_width ( self . title ) + 6 self . set_x (( 210 - width ) / 2 ) # Setting colors for frame, background and text: self . set_draw_color ( 0 , 80 , 180 ) self . set_fill_color ( 230 , 230 , 0 ) self . set_text_color ( 220 , 50 , 50 ) # Setting thickness of the frame (1 mm) self . set_line_width ( 1 ) # Printing title: self . cell ( width , 9 , self . title , 1 , 1 , \"C\" , True ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 10 ) def footer ( self ): # Setting position at 1.5 cm from bottom: self . set_y ( - 15 ) # Setting font: helvetica italic 8 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) # Setting text color to gray: self . set_text_color ( 128 ) # Printing page number self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) def chapter_title ( self , num , label ): # Setting font: helvetica 12 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"\" , 12 ) # Setting background color self . set_fill_color ( 200 , 220 , 255 ) # Printing chapter name: self . cell ( 0 , 6 , f \"Chapter { num } : { label } \" , 0 , 1 , \"L\" , True ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 4 ) def chapter_body ( self , filepath ): # Reading text file: with open ( filepath , \"rb\" ) as fh : txt = fh . read () . decode ( \"latin-1\" ) # Setting font: Times 12 self . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) # Printing justified text: self . multi_cell ( 0 , 5 , txt ) # Performing a line break: self . ln () # Final mention in italics: self . set_font ( style = \"I\" ) self . cell ( 0 , 5 , \"(end of excerpt)\" ) def print_chapter ( self , num , title , filepath ): self . add_page () self . chapter_title ( num , title ) self . chapter_body ( filepath ) pdf = PDF () pdf . set_title ( \"20000 Leagues Under the Seas\" ) pdf . set_author ( \"Jules Verne\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 1 , \"A RUNAWAY REEF\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 2 , \"THE PROS AND CONS\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto3.pdf\" ) PDF resultante Texto de J\u00falio Verne O m\u00e9todo get_string_width permite determinar o comprimento de uma string na fonte atual, e que \u00e9 usada aqui para calcular a posi\u00e7\u00e3o e a largura do quadro ao redor do t\u00edtulo. Em seguida, as cores s\u00e3o definidas (via set_draw_color , set_fill_color e set_text_color ) e a espessura da linha \u00e9 definida como 1 mm (contra 0,2 por padr\u00e3o) com set_line_width . Finalmente, produzimos a c\u00e9lula (se o \u00faltimo par\u00e2metro for verdadeiro, indica que o plano de fundo deve ser preenchido). O m\u00e9todo usado para imprimir os par\u00e1grafos \u00e9 multi_cell . Cada vez que uma linha atinge a extremidade direita da c\u00e9lula ou um c\u00f3digo de fim de linha \u00e9 encontrado, uma quebra de linha \u00e9 emitida e uma nova c\u00e9lula \u00e9 criada automaticamente sob a atual. O texto \u00e9 justificado por padr\u00e3o. Duas propriedades do documento s\u00e3o definidas: o t\u00edtulo ( set_title ) e o autor ( set_author ). As propriedades podem ser visualizadas de duas maneiras: A primeira \u00e9 abrir o documento diretamente com o Acrobat Reader, v\u00e1 para o menu Arquivo e escolha a op\u00e7\u00e3o Propriedades do documento. O segundo, tamb\u00e9m dispon\u00edvel no plug-in, \u00e9 clicar com o bot\u00e3o direito e selecionar Propriedades do documento.

Se isso for menor que 2 (optamos por dividir a p\u00e1gina em tr\u00eas colunas), chamando o m\u00e9todo set_col, aumentando o n\u00famero da coluna e alterando a posi\u00e7\u00e3o da pr\u00f3xima coluna para que o texto continue a\u00ed. Quando o limite inferior da terceira coluna \u00e9 alcan\u00e7ado, o m\u00e9todo accept_page_break ser\u00e1 redefinido e vai voltar para a primeira coluna e adicionar uma quebra de p\u00e1gina. Tuto 5 - Criar Tabelas Este tutorial ir\u00e1 explicar como criar tabelas facilmente. O c\u00f3digo seguinte cria tr\u00eas tabelas diferentes para explicar o que pode ser alcan\u00e7ado com alguns ajustes simples. import csv from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def basic_table ( self , headings , rows ): for heading in headings : self . cell ( 40 , 7 , heading , 1 ) self . ln () for row in rows : for col in row : self . cell ( 40 , 6 , col , 1 ) self . ln () def improved_table ( self , headings , rows , col_widths = ( 42 , 39 , 35 , 40 )): for col_width , heading in zip ( col_widths , headings ): self . cell ( col_width , 7 , heading , 1 , 0 , \"C\" ) self . ln () for row in rows : self . cell ( col_widths [ 0 ], 6 , row [ 0 ], \"LR\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 1 ], 6 , row [ 1 ], \"LR\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 2 ], 6 , row [ 2 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 3 ], 6 , row [ 3 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" ) self . ln () # Closure line: self . cell ( sum ( col_widths ), 0 , \"\" , \"T\" ) def colored_table ( self , headings , rows , col_widths = ( 42 , 39 , 35 , 42 )): # Colors, line width and bold font: self . set_fill_color ( 255 , 100 , 0 ) self . set_text_color ( 255 ) self . set_draw_color ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) self . set_line_width ( 0.3 ) self . set_font ( style = \"B\" ) for col_width , heading in zip ( col_widths , headings ): self . cell ( col_width , 7 , heading , 1 , 0 , \"C\" , True ) self . ln () # Color and font restoration: self . set_fill_color ( 224 , 235 , 255 ) self . set_text_color ( 0 ) self . set_font () fill = False for row in rows : self . cell ( col_widths [ 0 ], 6 , row [ 0 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"L\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 1 ], 6 , row [ 1 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"L\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 2 ], 6 , row [ 2 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 3 ], 6 , row [ 3 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" , fill ) self . ln () fill = not fill self . cell ( sum ( col_widths ), 0 , \"\" , \"T\" ) def load_data_from_csv ( csv_filepath ): headings , rows = [], [] with open ( csv_filepath , encoding = \"utf8\" ) as csv_file : for row in csv . reader ( csv_file , delimiter = \",\" ): if not headings : # extracting column names from first row: headings = row else : rows . append ( row ) return headings , rows col_names , data = load_data_from_csv ( \"countries.txt\" ) pdf = PDF () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , size = 14 ) pdf . add_page () pdf . basic_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . add_page () pdf . improved_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . add_page () pdf . colored_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . output ( \"tuto5.pdf\" ) PDF resultante - Texto dos pa\u00edses Uma vez que uma tabela \u00e9 apenas uma cole\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e9lulas, \u00e9 natural construir uma a partir delas. O primeiro exemplo \u00e9 obtido da maneira mais b\u00e1sica poss\u00edvel: moldura simples c\u00e9lulas, todas do mesmo tamanho e alinhadas \u00e0 esquerda. O resultado \u00e9 rudimentar, mas muito r\u00e1pido de obter. A segunda tabela traz algumas melhorias: cada coluna tem sua largura pr\u00f3pria, os t\u00edtulos est\u00e3o centrados e as figuras alinhadas \u00e0 direita. Al\u00e9m disso, as linhas horizontais foram removidas. Isto \u00e9 feito por meio do par\u00e2metro border do m\u00e9todo Cell(), que especifica quais lados da c\u00e9lula devem ser desenhados. Aqui n\u00f3s queremos os esquerdo (L) e direito (R). Agora apenas o problema da linha horizontal para terminar a mesa permanece. Existem duas possibilidades para resolv\u00ea-lo: verificar para a \u00faltima linha do loop, caso este em que usamos LRB para o par\u00e2metro da borda; ou, como foi feito aqui, adicione a linha assim que o loop terminar. A terceira tabela \u00e9 semelhante \u00e0 segunda, mas usa cores. Preenchimento, texto e as cores das linhas s\u00e3o simplesmente especificadas. Colora\u00e7\u00e3o alternativa para linhas \u00e9 obtida usando c\u00e9lulas alternativamente transparentes e preenchidas. Tuto 6 - Criar links e misturar estilos de texto Este tutorial ir\u00e1 explicar v\u00e1rias maneiras de inserir links dentro de um documento PDF, bem como adicionar links para fontes externas. Tamb\u00e9m mostrar\u00e1 v\u00e1rias maneiras de usar diferentes estilos de texto, (negrito, it\u00e1lico, sublinhado) no mesmo texto. from fpdf import FPDF , HTMLMixin class MyFPDF ( FPDF , HTMLMixin ): pass pdf = MyFPDF () # First page: pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , size = 20 ) pdf . write ( 5 , \"To find out what's new in self tutorial, click \" ) pdf . set_font ( style = \"U\" ) link = pdf . add_link () pdf . write ( 5 , \"here\" , link ) pdf . set_font () # Second page: pdf . add_page () pdf . set_link ( link ) pdf . image ( \"../docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , 10 , 10 , 50 , 0 , \"\" , \"https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/\" ) pdf . set_left_margin ( 60 ) pdf . set_font_size ( 18 ) pdf . write_html ( \"\"\"You can print text mixing different styles using HTML tags: <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underlined</u>, or <b><i><u>all at once</u></i></b>! <br><br>You can also insert links on text, such as <a href=\"https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/\">https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/</a>, or on an image: the logo is clickable!\"\"\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto6.pdf\" ) PDF resultante - fpdf2-logo O novo m\u00e9todo mostrado aqui para imprimir texto \u00e9 write() . \u00c9 muito parecido com multi_cell () , sendo as principais diferen\u00e7as: O fim da linha est\u00e1 na margem direita e a pr\u00f3xima linha come\u00e7a na margem esquerda. A posi\u00e7\u00e3o atual move-se para o final do texto. O m\u00e9todo, portanto, nos permite escrever um peda\u00e7o de texto, alterar o estilo da fonte, e continuar do ponto exato em que paramos. Por outro lado, a sua principal desvantagem \u00e9 que n\u00e3o podemos justificar o texto como n\u00f3s fazemos com o m\u00e9todo [multi_cell()(https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/fpdf/fpdf.html#fpdf.fpdf.FPDF.multi_cell) . Na primeira p\u00e1gina do exemplo, us\u00e1mos write() para este prop\u00f3sito. O in\u00edcio da frase est\u00e1 escrita no estilo de texto normal, depois usando o m\u00e9todo set_font() , trocamos para sublinhado e acab\u00e1mos a frase. Para adicionar o link externo a apontar para a segunda p\u00e1gina, n\u00f3s us\u00e1mos o m\u00e9todo add_link() , que cria uma \u00e1rea clic\u00e1vel \u00e0 qual demos o nome de \u201clink\u201d que direciona para outra parte do documento. Na segunda p\u00e1gina, us\u00e1mos set_link() para definir uma \u00e1rea de destino para o link que acab\u00e1mos de criar. Para criar o link externo usando uma imagem, us\u00e1mos image() . O m\u00e9todo tem a op\u00e7\u00e3o de passar um link como um dos seus argumentos. O link pode ser interno ou externo. Como alternativa, outra op\u00e7\u00e3o para mudar o estilo da fonte e adicionar links \u00e9 usar o m\u00e9todo write_html() . \u00c9 um \u201cparser\u201d que permite adicionar texto, mudar o estilo da fonte e adicionar links usando html.","title":"Tutorial #"},{"location":"Tutorial-pt.html#tutorial","text":"English version: Tutorial Version en fran\u00e7ais : Tutorial-fr Deutsche Version: Tutorial-de Versi\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol: Tutorial-es \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0930\u0923: Tutorial-\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 Versione in italiano: Tutorial-it \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c: Tutorial-ru Methods full documentation: fpdf.FPDF API doc Tutorial Tuto 1 - Exemplo M\u00ednimo Tuto 2 - Cabe\u00e7alho, rodap\u00e9, quebra de p\u00e1gina e imagem Tuto 3 - Quebras de linha e cores Tuto 4 - Multi Colunas Tuto 5 - Criar Tabelas Tuto 6 - Criar links e misturar estilos de texto","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"Tutorial-pt.html#tuto-1-exemplo-minimo","text":"Vamos come\u00e7ar com um exemplo cl\u00e1ssico: from fpdf import FPDF pdf = FPDF () pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 16 ) pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , \"Hello World!\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto1.pdf\" ) PDF resultante Ap\u00f3s incluirmos o ficheiro da biblioteca, criamos um objeto FPDF .

Se isso for menor que 2 (optamos por dividir a p\u00e1gina em tr\u00eas colunas), chamando o m\u00e9todo set_col, aumentando o n\u00famero da coluna e alterando a posi\u00e7\u00e3o da pr\u00f3xima coluna para que o texto continue a\u00ed.

O primeiro exemplo \u00e9 obtido da maneira mais b\u00e1sica poss\u00edvel: moldura simples c\u00e9lulas, todas do mesmo tamanho e alinhadas \u00e0 esquerda. O resultado \u00e9 rudimentar, mas muito r\u00e1pido de obter. A segunda tabela traz algumas melhorias: cada coluna tem sua largura pr\u00f3pria, os t\u00edtulos est\u00e3o centrados e as figuras alinhadas \u00e0 direita. Al\u00e9m disso, as linhas horizontais foram removidas. Isto \u00e9 feito por meio do par\u00e2metro border do m\u00e9todo Cell(), que especifica quais lados da c\u00e9lula devem ser desenhados. Aqui n\u00f3s queremos os esquerdo (L) e direito (R). Agora apenas o problema da linha horizontal para terminar a mesa permanece. Existem duas possibilidades para resolv\u00ea-lo: verificar para a \u00faltima linha do loop, caso este em que usamos LRB para o par\u00e2metro da borda; ou, como foi feito aqui, adicione a linha assim que o loop terminar. A terceira tabela \u00e9 semelhante \u00e0 segunda, mas usa cores. Preenchimento, texto e as cores das linhas s\u00e3o simplesmente especificadas. Colora\u00e7\u00e3o alternativa para linhas \u00e9 obtida usando c\u00e9lulas alternativamente transparentes e preenchidas.","title":"Tuto 5 - Criar Tabelas"},{"location":"Tutorial-pt.html#tuto-6-criar-links-e-misturar-estilos-de-texto","text":"Este tutorial ir\u00e1 explicar v\u00e1rias maneiras de inserir links dentro de um documento PDF, bem como adicionar links para fontes externas.

Para adicionar o link externo a apontar para a segunda p\u00e1gina, n\u00f3s us\u00e1mos o m\u00e9todo add_link() , que cria uma \u00e1rea clic\u00e1vel \u00e0 qual demos o nome de \u201clink\u201d que direciona para outra parte do documento.

API doc Tutorial Tuto 1 - Minimal Example Tuto 2 - Header, footer, page break and image Tuto 3 - Line breaks and colors Tuto 4 - Multi Columns Tuto 5 - Creating Tables Tuto 6 - Creating links and mixing text styles Tuto 1 - Minimal Example Let's start with the classic example: from fpdf import FPDF pdf = FPDF () pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 16 ) pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , \"Hello World!\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto1.pdf\" ) Resulting PDF After including the library file, we create an FPDF object. The FPDF constructor is used here with the default values: pages are in A4 portrait and the measure unit is millimeter. It could have been specified explicitly with: pdf = FPDF ( orientation = \"P\" , unit = \"mm\" , format = \"A4\" ) It is possible to set the PDF in landscape mode ( L ) or to use other page formats (such as Letter and Legal ) and measure units ( pt , cm , in ). There is no page for the moment, so we have to add one with add_page . The origin is at the upper-left corner and the current position is by default placed at 1 cm from the borders; the margins can be changed with set_margins . Before we can print text, it is mandatory to select a font with set_font , otherwise the document would be invalid. We choose Helvetica bold 16: pdf . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'B' , 16 ) We could have specified italics with I , underlined with U or a regular font with an empty string (or any combination). Note that the font size is given in points, not millimeters (or another user unit); it is the only exception. The other built-in fonts are Times , Courier , Symbol and ZapfDingbats . We can now print a cell with cell . A cell is a rectangular area, possibly framed, which contains some text. It is rendered at the current position. We specify its dimensions, its text (centered or aligned), if borders should be drawn, and where the current position moves after it (to the right, below or to the beginning of the next line). To add a frame, we would do this: pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , 'Hello World!' , 1 ) To add a new cell next to it with centered text and go to the next line, we would do: pdf . cell ( 60 , 10 , 'Powered by FPDF.' , ln = 1 , align = 'C' ) Remark : the line break can also be done with ln . This method allows to specify in addition the height of the break. Finally, the document is closed and saved under the provided file path using output . Without any parameter provided, output() returns the PDF bytearray buffer. Tuto 2 - Header, footer, page break and image Here is a two page example with header, footer and logo: from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def header ( self ): # Rendering logo: self . image ( \"../docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , 10 , 8 , 33 ) # Setting font: helvetica bold 15 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) # Moving cursor to the right: self . cell ( 80 ) # Printing title: self . cell ( 30 , 10 , \"Title\" , 1 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 20 ) def footer ( self ): # Position cursor at 1.5 cm from bottom: self . set_y ( - 15 ) # Setting font: helvetica italic 8 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) # Printing page number: self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } / {{ nb }} \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Instantiation of inherited class pdf = PDF () pdf . alias_nb_pages () pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) for i in range ( 1 , 41 ): pdf . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Printing line number { i } \" , 0 , 1 ) pdf . output ( \"tuto2.pdf\" ) Resulting PDF This example makes use of the header and footer methods to process page headers and footers. They are called automatically. They already exist in the FPDF class but do nothing, therefore we have to extend the class and override them. The logo is printed with the image method by specifying its upper-left corner and its width. The height is calculated automatically to respect the image proportions. To print the page number, a null value is passed as the cell width. It means that the cell should extend up to the right margin of the page; it is handy to center text. The current page number is returned by the page_no method; as for the total number of pages, it is obtained by means of the special value {nb} which will be substituted on document closure (provided you first called alias_nb_pages ). Note the use of the set_y method which allows to set position at an absolute location in the page, starting from the top or the bottom. Another interesting feature is used here: the automatic page breaking. As soon as a cell would cross a limit in the page (at 2 centimeters from the bottom by default), a break is performed and the font restored. Although the header and footer select their own font ( helvetica ), the body continues with Times . This mechanism of automatic restoration also applies to colors and line width. The limit which triggers page breaks can be set with set_auto_page_break . Tuto 3 - Line breaks and colors Let's continue with an example which prints justified paragraphs. It also illustrates the use of colors. from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def header ( self ): # Setting font: helvetica bold 15 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) # Calculating width of title and setting cursor position: width = self . get_string_width ( self . title ) + 6 self . set_x (( 210 - width ) / 2 ) # Setting colors for frame, background and text: self . set_draw_color ( 0 , 80 , 180 ) self . set_fill_color ( 230 , 230 , 0 ) self . set_text_color ( 220 , 50 , 50 ) # Setting thickness of the frame (1 mm) self . set_line_width ( 1 ) # Printing title: self . cell ( width , 9 , self . title , 1 , 1 , \"C\" , True ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 10 ) def footer ( self ): # Setting position at 1.5 cm from bottom: self . set_y ( - 15 ) # Setting font: helvetica italic 8 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) # Setting text color to gray: self . set_text_color ( 128 ) # Printing page number self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) def chapter_title ( self , num , label ): # Setting font: helvetica 12 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"\" , 12 ) # Setting background color self . set_fill_color ( 200 , 220 , 255 ) # Printing chapter name: self . cell ( 0 , 6 , f \"Chapter { num } : { label } \" , 0 , 1 , \"L\" , True ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 4 ) def chapter_body ( self , filepath ): # Reading text file: with open ( filepath , \"rb\" ) as fh : txt = fh . read () . decode ( \"latin-1\" ) # Setting font: Times 12 self . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) # Printing justified text: self . multi_cell ( 0 , 5 , txt ) # Performing a line break: self . ln () # Final mention in italics: self . set_font ( style = \"I\" ) self . cell ( 0 , 5 , \"(end of excerpt)\" ) def print_chapter ( self , num , title , filepath ): self . add_page () self . chapter_title ( num , title ) self . chapter_body ( filepath ) pdf = PDF () pdf . set_title ( \"20000 Leagues Under the Seas\" ) pdf . set_author ( \"Jules Verne\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 1 , \"A RUNAWAY REEF\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 2 , \"THE PROS AND CONS\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto3.pdf\" ) Resulting PDF Jules Verne text The get_string_width method allows determining the length of a string in the current font, which is used here to calculate the position and the width of the frame surrounding the title. Then colors are set (via set_draw_color , set_fill_color and set_text_color ) and the thickness of the line is set to 1 mm (against 0.2 by default) with set_line_width . Finally, we output the cell (the last parameter to true indicates that the background must be filled). The method used to print the paragraphs is multi_cell . Each time a line reaches the right extremity of the cell or a carriage return character is met, a line break is issued and a new cell automatically created under the current one. Text is justified by default. Two document properties are defined: the title ( set_title ) and the author ( set_author ). Properties can be viewed by two means. First is to open the document directly with Acrobat Reader, go to the File menu and choose the Document Properties option. The second, also available from the plug-in, is to right-click and select Document Properties. Tuto 4 - Multi Columns This example is a variant of the previous one, showing how to lay the text across multiple columns. from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def __init__ ( self ): super () . __init__ () self . col = 0 # Current column self . y0 = 0 # Ordinate of column start def header ( self ): self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) width = self . get_string_width ( self . title ) + 6 self . set_x (( 210 - width ) / 2 ) self . set_draw_color ( 0 , 80 , 180 ) self . set_fill_color ( 230 , 230 , 0 ) self . set_text_color ( 220 , 50 , 50 ) self . set_line_width ( 1 ) self . cell ( width , 9 , self . title , 1 , 1 , \"C\" , True ) self . ln ( 10 ) # Saving ordinate position: self . y0 = self . get_y () def footer ( self ): self . set_y ( - 15 ) self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) self . set_text_color ( 128 ) self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) def set_col ( self , col ): # Set column position: self . col = col x = 10 + col * 65 self . set_left_margin ( x ) self . set_x ( x ) @property def accept_page_break ( self ): if self . col < 2 : # Go to next column: self . set_col ( self . col + 1 ) # Set ordinate to top: self . set_y ( self . y0 ) # Stay on the same page: return False # Go back to first column: self . set_col ( 0 ) # Trigger a page break: return True def chapter_title ( self , num , label ): self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"\" , 12 ) self . set_fill_color ( 200 , 220 , 255 ) self . cell ( 0 , 6 , f \"Chapter { num } : { label } \" , 0 , 1 , \"L\" , True ) self . ln ( 4 ) # Saving ordinate position: self . y0 = self . get_y () def chapter_body ( self , name ): # Reading text file: with open ( name , \"rb\" ) as fh : txt = fh . read () . decode ( \"latin-1\" ) # Setting font: Times 12 self . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) # Printing text in a 6cm width column: self . multi_cell ( 60 , 5 , txt ) self . ln () # Final mention in italics: self . set_font ( style = \"I\" ) self . cell ( 0 , 5 , \"(end of excerpt)\" ) # Start back at first column: self . set_col ( 0 ) def print_chapter ( self , num , title , name ): self . add_page () self . chapter_title ( num , title ) self . chapter_body ( name ) pdf = PDF () pdf . set_title ( \"20000 Leagues Under the Seas\" ) pdf . set_author ( \"Jules Verne\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 1 , \"A RUNAWAY REEF\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 2 , \"THE PROS AND CONS\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto4.pdf\" ) Resulting PDF Jules Verne text The key difference from the previous tutorial is the use of the accept_page_break and the set_col methods. Using the accept_page_break method, once the cell crosses the bottom limit of the page, it will check the current column number. If it is less than 2 (we chose to divide the page in three columns) it will call the set_col method, increasing the column number and altering the position of the next column so the text may continue there. Once the bottom limit of the third column is reached, the accept_page_break method will reset and go back to the first column and trigger a page break. Tuto 5 - Creating Tables This tutorial will explain how to create tables easily. The code will create three different tables to explain what can be achieved with some simple adjustments. import csv from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def basic_table ( self , headings , rows ): for heading in headings : self . cell ( 40 , 7 , heading , 1 ) self . ln () for row in rows : for col in row : self . cell ( 40 , 6 , col , 1 ) self . ln () def improved_table ( self , headings , rows , col_widths = ( 42 , 39 , 35 , 40 )): for col_width , heading in zip ( col_widths , headings ): self . cell ( col_width , 7 , heading , 1 , 0 , \"C\" ) self . ln () for row in rows : self . cell ( col_widths [ 0 ], 6 , row [ 0 ], \"LR\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 1 ], 6 , row [ 1 ], \"LR\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 2 ], 6 , row [ 2 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 3 ], 6 , row [ 3 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" ) self . ln () # Closure line: self . cell ( sum ( col_widths ), 0 , \"\" , \"T\" ) def colored_table ( self , headings , rows , col_widths = ( 42 , 39 , 35 , 42 )): # Colors, line width and bold font: self . set_fill_color ( 255 , 100 , 0 ) self . set_text_color ( 255 ) self . set_draw_color ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) self . set_line_width ( 0.3 ) self . set_font ( style = \"B\" ) for col_width , heading in zip ( col_widths , headings ): self . cell ( col_width , 7 , heading , 1 , 0 , \"C\" , True ) self . ln () # Color and font restoration: self . set_fill_color ( 224 , 235 , 255 ) self . set_text_color ( 0 ) self . set_font () fill = False for row in rows : self . cell ( col_widths [ 0 ], 6 , row [ 0 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"L\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 1 ], 6 , row [ 1 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"L\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 2 ], 6 , row [ 2 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" , fill ) self . cell ( col_widths [ 3 ], 6 , row [ 3 ], \"LR\" , 0 , \"R\" , fill ) self . ln () fill = not fill self . cell ( sum ( col_widths ), 0 , \"\" , \"T\" ) def load_data_from_csv ( csv_filepath ): headings , rows = [], [] with open ( csv_filepath , encoding = \"utf8\" ) as csv_file : for row in csv . reader ( csv_file , delimiter = \",\" ): if not headings : # extracting column names from first row: headings = row else : rows . append ( row ) return headings , rows col_names , data = load_data_from_csv ( \"countries.txt\" ) pdf = PDF () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , size = 14 ) pdf . add_page () pdf . basic_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . add_page () pdf . improved_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . add_page () pdf . colored_table ( col_names , data ) pdf . output ( \"tuto5.pdf\" ) Resulting PDF - Countries text Since a table is just a collection of cells, it is natural to build one from them. The first example is achieved in the most basic way possible: simple framed cells, all of the same size and left aligned. The result is rudimentary but very quick to obtain. The second table brings some improvements: each column has its own width, titles are centered and figures right aligned. Moreover, horizontal lines have been removed. This is done by means of the border parameter of the Cell() method, which specifies which sides of the cell must be drawn. Here we want the left (L) and right (R) ones. Now only the problem of the horizontal line to finish the table remains. There are two possibilities to solv it: check for the last line in the loop, in which case we use LRB for the border parameter; or, as done here, add the line once the loop is over. The third table is similar to the second one but uses colors. Fill, text and line colors are simply specified. Alternate coloring for rows is obtained by using alternatively transparent and filled cells. Tuto 6 - Creating links and mixing text styles This tutorial will explain several ways to insert links inside a pdf document, as well as adding links to external sources. It will also show several ways we can use different text styles, (bold, italic, underline) within the same text. from fpdf import FPDF , HTMLMixin class MyFPDF ( FPDF , HTMLMixin ): pass pdf = MyFPDF () # First page: pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , size = 20 ) pdf . write ( 5 , \"To find out what's new in self tutorial, click \" ) pdf . set_font ( style = \"U\" ) link = pdf . add_link () pdf . write ( 5 , \"here\" , link ) pdf . set_font () # Second page: pdf . add_page () pdf . set_link ( link ) pdf . image ( \"../docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , 10 , 10 , 50 , 0 , \"\" , \"https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/\" ) pdf . set_left_margin ( 60 ) pdf . set_font_size ( 18 ) pdf . write_html ( \"\"\"You can print text mixing different styles using HTML tags: <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underlined</u>, or <b><i><u>all at once</u></i></b>! <br><br>You can also insert links on text, such as <a href=\"https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/\">https://pyfpdf.github.io/fpdf2/</a>, or on an image: the logo is clickable!\"\"\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto6.pdf\" ) Resulting PDF - fpdf2-logo The new method shown here to print text is write() . It is very similar to multi_cell() , the key differences being: The end of line is at the right margin and the next line begins at the left margin. The current position moves to the end of the text. The method therefore allows us to write a chunk of text, alter the font style, and continue from the exact place we left off. On the other hand, its main drawback is that we cannot justify the text like we do with the multi_cell() method. In the first page of the example, we used write() for this purpose. The beginning of the sentence is written in regular style text, then using the set_font() method, we switched to underline and finished the sentence. To add an internal link pointing to the second page, we used the add_link() method, which creates a clickable area which we named \"link\" that directs to another place within the document. On the second page, we used set_link() to define the destination area for the link we just created. To create the external link using an image, we used image() . The method has the option to pass a link as one of its arguments. The link can be both internal or external. As an alternative, another option to change the font style and add links is to use the write_html() method. It is an html parser, which allows adding text, changing font style and adding links using html.","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"Tutorial.html#tutorial","text":"Version en fran\u00e7ais : Tutorial-fr Deutsche Version: Tutorial-de Versi\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol: Tutorial-es \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0930\u0923: Tutorial-\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 Versione in italiano: Tutorial-it Vers\u00e3o em portugu\u00eas: Tutorial-pt \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c: Tutorial-ru Methods full documentation: fpdf.FPDF API doc Tutorial Tuto 1 - Minimal Example Tuto 2 - Header, footer, page break and image Tuto 3 - Line breaks and colors Tuto 4 - Multi Columns Tuto 5 - Creating Tables Tuto 6 - Creating links and mixing text styles","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"Tutorial.html#tuto-1-minimal-example","text":"Let's start with the classic example: from fpdf import FPDF pdf = FPDF () pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 16 ) pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , \"Hello World!\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto1.pdf\" ) Resulting PDF After including the library file, we create an FPDF object. The FPDF constructor is used here with the default values: pages are in A4 portrait and the measure unit is millimeter. It could have been specified explicitly with: pdf = FPDF ( orientation = \"P\" , unit = \"mm\" , format = \"A4\" ) It is possible to set the PDF in landscape mode ( L ) or to use other page formats (such as Letter and Legal ) and measure units ( pt , cm , in ). There is no page for the moment, so we have to add one with add_page . The origin is at the upper-left corner and the current position is by default placed at 1 cm from the borders; the margins can be changed with set_margins . Before we can print text, it is mandatory to select a font with set_font , otherwise the document would be invalid. We choose Helvetica bold 16: pdf . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'B' , 16 ) We could have specified italics with I , underlined with U or a regular font with an empty string (or any combination). Note that the font size is given in points, not millimeters (or another user unit); it is the only exception. The other built-in fonts are Times , Courier , Symbol and ZapfDingbats . We can now print a cell with cell . A cell is a rectangular area, possibly framed, which contains some text. It is rendered at the current position. We specify its dimensions, its text (centered or aligned), if borders should be drawn, and where the current position moves after it (to the right, below or to the beginning of the next line). To add a frame, we would do this: pdf . cell ( 40 , 10 , 'Hello World!' , 1 ) To add a new cell next to it with centered text and go to the next line, we would do: pdf . cell ( 60 , 10 , 'Powered by FPDF.' , ln = 1 , align = 'C' ) Remark : the line break can also be done with ln . This method allows to specify in addition the height of the break. Finally, the document is closed and saved under the provided file path using output . Without any parameter provided, output() returns the PDF bytearray buffer.","title":"Tuto 1 - Minimal Example"},{"location":"Tutorial.html#tuto-2-header-footer-page-break-and-image","text":"Here is a two page example with header, footer and logo: from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def header ( self ): # Rendering logo: self . image ( \"../docs/fpdf2-logo.png\" , 10 , 8 , 33 ) # Setting font: helvetica bold 15 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) # Moving cursor to the right: self . cell ( 80 ) # Printing title: self . cell ( 30 , 10 , \"Title\" , 1 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Performing a line break: self . ln ( 20 ) def footer ( self ): # Position cursor at 1.5 cm from bottom: self . set_y ( - 15 ) # Setting font: helvetica italic 8 self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) # Printing page number: self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } / {{ nb }} \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) # Instantiation of inherited class pdf = PDF () pdf . alias_nb_pages () pdf . add_page () pdf . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) for i in range ( 1 , 41 ): pdf . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Printing line number { i } \" , 0 , 1 ) pdf . output ( \"tuto2.pdf\" ) Resulting PDF This example makes use of the header and footer methods to process page headers and footers. They are called automatically. They already exist in the FPDF class but do nothing, therefore we have to extend the class and override them. The logo is printed with the image method by specifying its upper-left corner and its width. The height is calculated automatically to respect the image proportions. To print the page number, a null value is passed as the cell width. It means that the cell should extend up to the right margin of the page; it is handy to center text. The current page number is returned by the page_no method; as for the total number of pages, it is obtained by means of the special value {nb} which will be substituted on document closure (provided you first called alias_nb_pages ). Note the use of the set_y method which allows to set position at an absolute location in the page, starting from the top or the bottom. Another interesting feature is used here: the automatic page breaking. As soon as a cell would cross a limit in the page (at 2 centimeters from the bottom by default), a break is performed and the font restored. Although the header and footer select their own font ( helvetica ), the body continues with Times . This mechanism of automatic restoration also applies to colors and line width. The limit which triggers page breaks can be set with set_auto_page_break .","title":"Tuto 2 - Header, footer, page break and image"},{"location":"Tutorial.html#tuto-3-line-breaks-and-colors","text":"Let's continue with an example which prints justified paragraphs.

Then colors are set (via set_draw_color , set_fill_color and set_text_color ) and the thickness of the line is set to 1 mm (against 0.2 by default) with set_line_width . Finally, we output the cell (the last parameter to true indicates that the background must be filled). The method used to print the paragraphs is multi_cell . Each time a line reaches the right extremity of the cell or a carriage return character is met, a line break is issued and a new cell automatically created under the current one. Text is justified by default. Two document properties are defined: the title ( set_title ) and the author ( set_author ). Properties can be viewed by two means. First is to open the document directly with Acrobat Reader, go to the File menu and choose the Document Properties option. The second, also available from the plug-in, is to right-click and select Document Properties.","title":"Tuto 3 - Line breaks and colors"},{"location":"Tutorial.html#tuto-4-multi-columns","text":"This example is a variant of the previous one, showing how to lay the text across multiple columns. from fpdf import FPDF class PDF ( FPDF ): def __init__ ( self ): super () . __init__ () self . col = 0 # Current column self . y0 = 0 # Ordinate of column start def header ( self ): self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"B\" , 15 ) width = self . get_string_width ( self . title ) + 6 self . set_x (( 210 - width ) / 2 ) self . set_draw_color ( 0 , 80 , 180 ) self . set_fill_color ( 230 , 230 , 0 ) self . set_text_color ( 220 , 50 , 50 ) self . set_line_width ( 1 ) self . cell ( width , 9 , self . title , 1 , 1 , \"C\" , True ) self . ln ( 10 ) # Saving ordinate position: self . y0 = self . get_y () def footer ( self ): self . set_y ( - 15 ) self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"I\" , 8 ) self . set_text_color ( 128 ) self . cell ( 0 , 10 , f \"Page { self . page_no () } \" , 0 , 0 , \"C\" ) def set_col ( self , col ): # Set column position: self . col = col x = 10 + col * 65 self . set_left_margin ( x ) self . set_x ( x ) @property def accept_page_break ( self ): if self . col < 2 : # Go to next column: self . set_col ( self . col + 1 ) # Set ordinate to top: self . set_y ( self . y0 ) # Stay on the same page: return False # Go back to first column: self . set_col ( 0 ) # Trigger a page break: return True def chapter_title ( self , num , label ): self . set_font ( \"helvetica\" , \"\" , 12 ) self . set_fill_color ( 200 , 220 , 255 ) self . cell ( 0 , 6 , f \"Chapter { num } : { label } \" , 0 , 1 , \"L\" , True ) self . ln ( 4 ) # Saving ordinate position: self . y0 = self . get_y () def chapter_body ( self , name ): # Reading text file: with open ( name , \"rb\" ) as fh : txt = fh . read () . decode ( \"latin-1\" ) # Setting font: Times 12 self . set_font ( \"Times\" , size = 12 ) # Printing text in a 6cm width column: self . multi_cell ( 60 , 5 , txt ) self . ln () # Final mention in italics: self . set_font ( style = \"I\" ) self . cell ( 0 , 5 , \"(end of excerpt)\" ) # Start back at first column: self . set_col ( 0 ) def print_chapter ( self , num , title , name ): self . add_page () self . chapter_title ( num , title ) self . chapter_body ( name ) pdf = PDF () pdf . set_title ( \"20000 Leagues Under the Seas\" ) pdf . set_author ( \"Jules Verne\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 1 , \"A RUNAWAY REEF\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . print_chapter ( 2 , \"THE PROS AND CONS\" , \"20k_c1.txt\" ) pdf . output ( \"tuto4.pdf\" ) Resulting PDF Jules Verne text The key difference from the previous tutorial is the use of the accept_page_break and the set_col methods. Using the accept_page_break method, once the cell crosses the bottom limit of the page, it will check the current column number. If it is less than 2 (we chose to divide the page in three columns) it will call the set_col method, increasing the column number and altering the position of the next column so the text may continue there. Once the bottom limit of the third column is reached, the accept_page_break method will reset and go back to the first column and trigger a page break.","title":"Tuto 4 - Multi Columns"},{"location":"Tutorial.html#tuto-5-creating-tables","text":"This tutorial will explain how to create tables easily.

The first example is achieved in the most basic way possible: simple framed cells, all of the same size and left aligned. The result is rudimentary but very quick to obtain. The second table brings some improvements: each column has its own width, titles are centered and figures right aligned. Moreover, horizontal lines have been removed. This is done by means of the border parameter of the Cell() method, which specifies which sides of the cell must be drawn. Here we want the left (L) and right (R) ones. Now only the problem of the horizontal line to finish the table remains. There are two possibilities to solv it: check for the last line in the loop, in which case we use LRB for the border parameter; or, as done here, add the line once the loop is over. The third table is similar to the second one but uses colors. Fill, text and line colors are simply specified. Alternate coloring for rows is obtained by using alternatively transparent and filled cells.","title":"Tuto 5 - Creating Tables"},{"location":"Tutorial.html#tuto-6-creating-links-and-mixing-text-styles","text":"This tutorial will explain several ways to insert links inside a pdf document, as well as adding links to external sources.

Moreover, it embeds only the necessary parts of the fonts that are used in the document, making the file size much smaller than if the whole fonts were embedded. These features were originally developed for the mPDF project, and ported from Ian Back 's sFPDF LGPL PHP version. Before you can use UTF-8, you have to install at least one Unicode font in the font directory (or system font folder).

Such metrics are stored using the Python Pickle format ( .pkl extension), by default in the font directory (ensure read and write permission!). Additional information about the caching mechanism is defined in the add_font method documentation. TTF metric files often weigh about 650K, so keep that in mind if you use many TTF fonts and have disk size or memory limitations. By design, metric files are not imported as they could cause a temporary memory leak if not managed properly (this could be an issue in a webserver environment with many processes or threads, so the current implementation discards metrics when FPDF objects are disposed). In most circumstances, you will not notice any difference about storing metric files vs. generating them in each run on-the-fly (according basic tests, elapsed time is equivalent; YMMV). Like the original PHP implementation, this library should work even if it could not store the metric file, and as no source code file is generated at runtime, it should work in restricted environments. Free Font Pack and Copyright Restrictions For your convenience, this library collected 96 TTF files in an optional \"Free Unicode TrueType Font Pack for FPDF\" , with useful fonts commonly distributed with GNU/Linux operating systems (see above for a complete description). This pack is included in the Windows installers, or can be downloaded separately (for any operating system). You could use any TTF font file as long embedding usage is allowed in the licence. If not, a runtime exception will be raised saying: \"ERROR - Font file filename.ttf cannot be embedded due to copyright restrictions.\"","title":"Unicode"},{"location":"Unicode.html#unicode","text":"Unicode Example Metric Files Free Font Pack and Copyright Restrictions The FPDF class was modified adding UTF-8 support. Moreover, it embeds only the necessary parts of the fonts that are used in the document, making the file size much smaller than if the whole fonts were embedded. These features were originally developed for the mPDF project, and ported from Ian Back 's sFPDF LGPL PHP version. Before you can use UTF-8, you have to install at least one Unicode font in the font directory (or system font folder). Some free font packages are available for download (extract them into the font folder): DejaVu family: Sans, Sans Condensed, Serif, Serif Condensed, Sans Mono (Supports more than 200 languages) GNU FreeFont family: FreeSans, FreeSerif, FreeMono Indic (ttf-indic-fonts Debian and Ubuntu package) for Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi (including the variants for Punjabi), Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Tibetan AR PL New Sung (firefly): The Open Source Chinese Font (also supports other east Asian languages) Alee (ttf-alee Arch Linux package): General purpose Hangul Truetype fonts that contain Korean syllable and Latin9 (iso8859-15) characters.

Such metrics are stored using the Python Pickle format ( .pkl extension), by default in the font directory (ensure read and write permission!). Additional information about the caching mechanism is defined in the add_font method documentation. TTF metric files often weigh about 650K, so keep that in mind if you use many TTF fonts and have disk size or memory limitations. By design, metric files are not imported as they could cause a temporary memory leak if not managed properly (this could be an issue in a webserver environment with many processes or threads, so the current implementation discards metrics when FPDF objects are disposed).

Sample Report You could make a \"professional looking\" bussiness report just using web2py HTML helpers, mixin headers, logos, charts, text and tables. The main advantage of this method is that the same report can be rendered in a HTML view, or can be downloaded as PDF, with a minimal effort: Sample: report.pdf Updated Live Demo (HTML and PDF version): http://www.web2py.com.ar/fpdf/default/report http://www.web2py.com.ar/fpdf/default/report.pdf def report (): response . title = \"web2py sample report\" # include a google chart (download it dynamically!) url = \"http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chd=t:60,40&chs=500x200&chl=Hello|World&.png\" chart = IMG ( _src = url , _width = \"250\" , _height = \"100\" ) # create a small table with some data: rows = [ THEAD ( TR ( TH ( \"Key\" , _width = \"70%\" ), TH ( \"Value\" , _width = \"30%\" ))), TBODY ( TR ( TD ( \"Hello\" ), TD ( \"60\" )), TR ( TD ( \"World\" ), TD ( \"40\" )))] table = TABLE ( * rows , _border = \"0\" , _align = \"center\" , _width = \"50%\" ) if request . extension == \"pdf\" : from gluon.contrib.fpdf import FPDF , HTMLMixin # create a custom class with the required functionality class MyFPDF ( FPDF , HTMLMixin ): def header ( self ): \"\"\"hook to draw custom page header (logo and title)\"\"\" logo = os . path . join ( request . env . web2py_path , \"gluon\" , \"contrib\" , \"pyfpdf\" , \"tutorial\" , \"logo_pb.png\" ) self . image ( logo , 10 , 8 , 33 ) self . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'B' , 15 ) self . cell ( 65 ) # padding self . cell ( 60 , 10 , response . title , 1 , 0 , 'C' ) self . ln ( 20 ) def footer ( self ): \"\"\"hook to draw custom page footer (printing page numbers)\"\"\" self . set_y ( - 15 ) self . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'I' , 8 ) txt = f 'Page { self . page_no () } of { self . alias_nb_pages () } ' self . cell ( 0 , 10 , txt , 0 , 0 , 'C' ) pdf = MyFPDF () # create a page and serialize/render HTML objects pdf . add_page () pdf . write_html ( str ( XML ( table , sanitize = False ))) pdf . write_html ( str ( XML ( CENTER ( chart ), sanitize = False ))) # prepare PDF to download: response . headers [ 'Content-Type' ] = 'application/pdf' return pdf . output () else : # normal html view: return dict ( chart = chart , table = table ) Sample Table Listing Also, you can make nice tables that automatically spreads over several pages, with headers and footers, column and row highlighting, etc., in a very pythonic way: Sample: listing.pdf Updated Live Demo (HTML and PDF version): http://www.web2py.com.ar/fpdf/default/listing http://www.web2py.com.ar/fpdf/default/listing.pdf def listing (): response . title = \"web2py sample listing\" # define header and footers: head = THEAD ( TR ( TH ( \"Header 1\" , _width = \"50%\" ), TH ( \"Header 2\" , _width = \"30%\" ), TH ( \"Header 3\" , _width = \"20%\" ), _bgcolor = \"#A0A0A0\" )) foot = TFOOT ( TR ( TH ( \"Footer 1\" , _width = \"50%\" ), TH ( \"Footer 2\" , _width = \"30%\" ), TH ( \"Footer 3\" , _width = \"20%\" ), _bgcolor = \"#E0E0E0\" )) # create several rows: rows = [] for i in range ( 1000 ): col = i % 2 and \"#F0F0F0\" or \"#FFFFFF\" rows . append ( TR ( TD ( \"Row %s \" % i ), TD ( \"something\" , _align = \"center\" ), TD ( \" %s \" % i , _align = \"right\" ), _bgcolor = col )) # make the table object body = TBODY ( * rows ) table = TABLE ( * [ head , foot , body ], _border = \"1\" , _align = \"center\" , _width = \"100%\" ) if request . extension == \"pdf\" : from gluon.contrib.fpdf import FPDF , HTMLMixin # define our FPDF class (move to modules if it is reused frequently) class MyFPDF ( FPDF , HTMLMixin ): def header ( self ): self . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'B' , 15 ) self . cell ( 0 , 10 , response . title , 1 , 0 , 'C' ) self . ln ( 20 ) def footer ( self ): self . set_y ( - 15 ) self . set_font ( 'helvetica' , 'I' , 8 ) txt = 'Page %s of %s ' % ( self . page_no (), self . alias_nb_pages ()) self . cell ( 0 , 10 , txt , 0 , 0 , 'C' ) pdf = MyFPDF () # first page: pdf . add_page () pdf . write_html ( str ( XML ( table , sanitize = False ))) response . headers [ 'Content-Type' ] = 'application/pdf' return pdf . output () else : # normal html view: return dict ( table = table )}}} Samples Template Definitions As stated in the Templates page, there are 3 ways of putting your templates in place. As in that page there are samples for the manually hardcoded way and CSV document loading. Here we will only show a sample of the template engine. Sample Templating Engine PyFPDF and web2py can be used to make PDF documents using templates like invoices, badges, certificates, etc.: Sample: invoice.pdf Updated Live Demo: http://www.web2py.com.ar/fpdf/default/invoice.pdf To handle multiple templates, we can define two tables in web2py: pdf_template: general document information (name, paper size, etc.) pdf_element: several rows for each document, describing graphics primitives and placeholders. In db.py write: db . define_table ( \"pdf_template\" , Field ( \"pdf_template_id\" , \"id\" ), Field ( \"title\" ), Field ( \"format\" , requires = IS_IN_SET ([ \"A4\" , \"legal\" , \"letter\" ])), ) db . define_table ( \"pdf_element\" , Field ( \"pdf_template_id\" , db . pdf_template , requires = IS_IN_DB ( db , 'pdf_template.pdf_template_id' , 'pdf_template.title' )), Field ( \"name\" , requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY ()), Field ( \"type\" , length = 2 , requires = IS_IN_SET ([ 'T' , 'L' , 'I' , 'B' , 'BC' ])), Field ( \"x1\" , \"double\" , requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY ()), Field ( \"y1\" , \"double\" , requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY ()), Field ( \"x2\" , \"double\" , requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY ()), Field ( \"y2\" , \"double\" , requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY ()), Field ( \"font\" , default = \"helvetica\" , requires = IS_IN_SET ([ 'Courier' , 'helvetica' , 'Times' , 'Symbol' , 'Zapfdingbats' ])), Field ( \"size\" , \"double\" , default = \"10\" , requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY ()), Field ( \"bold\" , \"boolean\" ), Field ( \"italic\" , \"boolean\" ), Field ( \"underline\" , \"boolean\" ), Field ( \"foreground\" , \"integer\" , default = 0x000000 , comment = \"Color text\" ), Field ( \"background\" , \"integer\" , default = 0xFFFFFF , comment = \"Fill color\" ), Field ( \"align\" , \"string\" , length = 1 , default = \"L\" , requires = IS_IN_SET ([ 'L' , 'R' , 'C' , 'J' ])), Field ( \"text\" , \"text\" , comment = \"Default text\" ), Field ( \"priority\" , \"integer\" , default = 0 , comment = \"Z-Order\" ), ) Warning : the fields \"type\", \"size\" and \"text\" are reserved words for some DB engines, so validation: db = DAL ( 'sqlite://storage.sqlite' , pool_size = 1 , check_reserved = [ 'ALL' ]) will fail. sqlite, MySQL and postgres work OK. Proposals for new naming ideas are welcome. At this point you could go to web2py AppAdmin and start to define your document templates, or use import/export functions to reuse your already defined formats! Note: if you used designer.py to create the templates, and you want to import the templates with the Web2Py database admin, you will have to modify the file. So, designer.py outputs a file like this: line0;T;20.0;13.0;190.0;13.0;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;65535;C;;0 line1;T;20.0;67.0;190.0;67.0;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;65535;C;;0 name0;T;21;14;104;25;times;16.0;0;0;0;0;0;C;;2 title0;T;64;26;104;30;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;0;C;;2 You will have to make it look lke this: pdf_element.pdf_template_id, pdf_element.name, pdf_element.type, pdf_element.x1, pdf_element.y1, pdf_element.x2, pdf_element.y2, pdf_element.font, pdf_element.size, pdf_element.bold, pdf_element.italic, pdf_element.underline, pdf_element.foreground, pdf_element.background, pdf_element.align, pdf_element.text, pdf_element.priority 1,line0,T,20.0,283.0,190.0,283.0,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,65535,C,,0 1,line1,T,20.0,337.0,190.0,337.0,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,65535,C,,0 1,name0,T,21,14,104,25,times,16.0,0,0,0,0,0,C,,2 1,title0,T,64,26,104,30,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,0,C,,2 Where the first number indicates the template ID (important for the database system), and the first line indicates the database fields to fill. A simple Python script should do the trick. After defining and filling your database, you can use PyFPDF Templates directly reading row elements from the web2py database: For example, for an invoice, in a controller you could write: def invoice (): from gluon.contrib.fpdf import Template import os.path # generate sample invoice (according Argentina's regulations) import random from decimal import Decimal # read elements from db elements = db ( db . pdf_element . pdf_template_id == 1 ) . select ( orderby = db . pdf_element . priority ) f = Template ( format = \"A4\" , elements = elements , title = \"Sample Invoice\" , author = \"Sample Company\" , subject = \"Sample Customer\" , keywords = \"Electronic TAX Invoice\" ) # create some random invoice line items and detail data detail = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur. \" * 5 items = [] for i in range ( 1 , 30 ): ds = \"Sample product %s \" % i qty = random . randint ( 1 , 10 ) price = round ( random . random () * 100 , 3 ) code = \" %s%s%02d \" % ( chr ( random . randint ( 65 , 90 )), chr ( random . randint ( 65 , 90 )), i ) items . append ( dict ( code = code , unit = 'u' , qty = qty , price = price , amount = qty * price , ds = \" %s : %s \" % ( i , ds ))) # divide and count lines lines = 0 li_items = [] for it in items : qty = it [ 'qty' ] code = it [ 'code' ] unit = it [ 'unit' ] for ds in f . split_multicell ( it [ 'ds' ], 'item_description01' ): # add item description line (without price nor amount) li_items . append ( dict ( code = code , ds = ds , qty = qty , unit = unit , price = None , amount = None )) # clean qty and code (show only at first) unit = qty = code = None # set last item line price and amount li_items [ - 1 ] . update ( amount = it [ 'amount' ], price = it [ 'price' ]) # split detail into each line description obs = \" \\n <U>Detail:</U> \\n\\n \" + detail for ds in f . split_multicell ( obs , 'item_description01' ): li_items . append ( dict ( code = code , ds = ds , qty = qty , unit = unit , price = None , amount = None )) # calculate pages: lines = len ( li_items ) max_lines_per_page = 24 pages = lines / ( max_lines_per_page - 1 ) if lines % ( max_lines_per_page - 1 ): pages = pages + 1 # fill placeholders for each page for page in range ( 1 , pages + 1 ): f . add_page () f [ 'page' ] = 'Page %s of %s ' % ( page , pages ) if pages > 1 and page < pages : s = 'Continues on page %s ' % ( page + 1 ) else : s = '' f [ 'item_description %02d ' % ( max_lines_per_page + 1 )] = s f [ \"company_name\" ] = \"Sample Company\" f [ \"company_logo\" ] = os . path . join ( request . env . web2py_path , \"gluon\" , \"contrib\" , \"pyfpdf\" , \"tutorial\" , \"logo.png\" ) f [ \"company_header1\" ] = \"Some Address - somewhere -\" f [ \"company_header2\" ] = \"http://www.example.com\" f [ \"company_footer1\" ] = \"Tax Code ...\" f [ \"company_footer2\" ] = \"Tax/VAT ID ...\" f [ 'number' ] = '0001-00001234' f [ 'issue_date' ] = '2010-09-10' f [ 'due_date' ] = '2099-09-10' f [ 'customer_name' ] = \"Sample Client\" f [ 'customer_address' ] = \"Siempreviva 1234\" # print line item... li = 0 k = 0 total = Decimal ( \"0.00\" ) for it in li_items : k = k + 1 if k > page * ( max_lines_per_page - 1 ): break if it [ 'amount' ]: total += Decimal ( \" %.6f \" % it [ 'amount' ]) if k > ( page - 1 ) * ( max_lines_per_page - 1 ): li += 1 if it [ 'qty' ] is not None : f [ 'item_quantity %02d ' % li ] = it [ 'qty' ] if it [ 'code' ] is not None : f [ 'item_code %02d ' % li ] = it [ 'code' ] if it [ 'unit' ] is not None : f [ 'item_unit %02d ' % li ] = it [ 'unit' ] f [ 'item_description %02d ' % li ] = it [ 'ds' ] if it [ 'price' ] is not None : f [ 'item_price %02d ' % li ] = \" %0.3f \" % it [ 'price' ] if it [ 'amount' ] is not None : f [ 'item_amount %02d ' % li ] = \" %0.2f \" % it [ 'amount' ] # last page? print totals: if pages == page : f [ 'net' ] = \" %0.2f \" % ( total / Decimal ( \"1.21\" )) f [ 'vat' ] = \" %0.2f \" % ( total * ( 1 - 1 / Decimal ( \"1.21\" ))) f [ 'total_label' ] = 'Total:' else : f [ 'total_label' ] = 'SubTotal:' f [ 'total' ] = \" %0.2f \" % total response . headers [ 'Content-Type' ] = 'application/pdf' return f . render ( 'invoice.pdf' ) Of course, this is a hardcoded example.

Proposals for new naming ideas are welcome. At this point you could go to web2py AppAdmin and start to define your document templates, or use import/export functions to reuse your already defined formats! Note: if you used designer.py to create the templates, and you want to import the templates with the Web2Py database admin, you will have to modify the file. So, designer.py outputs a file like this: line0;T;20.0;13.0;190.0;13.0;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;65535;C;;0 line1;T;20.0;67.0;190.0;67.0;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;65535;C;;0 name0;T;21;14;104;25;times;16.0;0;0;0;0;0;C;;2 title0;T;64;26;104;30;times;10.0;0;0;0;0;0;C;;2 You will have to make it look lke this: pdf_element.pdf_template_id, pdf_element.name, pdf_element.type, pdf_element.x1, pdf_element.y1, pdf_element.x2, pdf_element.y2, pdf_element.font, pdf_element.size, pdf_element.bold, pdf_element.italic, pdf_element.underline, pdf_element.foreground, pdf_element.background, pdf_element.align, pdf_element.text, pdf_element.priority 1,line0,T,20.0,283.0,190.0,283.0,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,65535,C,,0 1,line1,T,20.0,337.0,190.0,337.0,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,65535,C,,0 1,name0,T,21,14,104,25,times,16.0,0,0,0,0,0,C,,2 1,title0,T,64,26,104,30,times,10.0,0,0,0,0,0,C,,2 Where the first number indicates the template ID (important for the database system), and the first line indicates the database fields to fill. A simple Python script should do the trick. After defining and filling your database, you can use PyFPDF Templates directly reading row elements from the web2py database: For example, for an invoice, in a controller you could write: def invoice (): from gluon.contrib.fpdf import Template import os.path # generate sample invoice (according Argentina's regulations) import random from decimal import Decimal # read elements from db elements = db ( db . pdf_element . pdf_template_id == 1 ) . select ( orderby = db . pdf_element . priority ) f = Template ( format = \"A4\" , elements = elements , title = \"Sample Invoice\" , author = \"Sample Company\" , subject = \"Sample Customer\" , keywords = \"Electronic TAX Invoice\" ) # create some random invoice line items and detail data detail = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur. \" * 5 items = [] for i in range ( 1 , 30 ): ds = \"Sample product %s \" % i qty = random . randint ( 1 , 10 ) price = round ( random . random () * 100 , 3 ) code = \" %s%s%02d \" % ( chr ( random . randint ( 65 , 90 )), chr ( random . randint ( 65 , 90 )), i ) items . append ( dict ( code = code , unit = 'u' , qty = qty , price = price , amount = qty * price , ds = \" %s : %s \" % ( i , ds ))) # divide and count lines lines = 0 li_items = [] for it in items : qty = it [ 'qty' ] code = it [ 'code' ] unit = it [ 'unit' ] for ds in f . split_multicell ( it [ 'ds' ], 'item_description01' ): # add item description line (without price nor amount) li_items . append ( dict ( code = code , ds = ds , qty = qty , unit = unit , price = None , amount = None )) # clean qty and code (show only at first) unit = qty = code = None # set last item line price and amount li_items [ - 1 ] . update ( amount = it [ 'amount' ], price = it [ 'price' ]) # split detail into each line description obs = \" \\n <U>Detail:</U> \\n\\n \" + detail for ds in f . split_multicell ( obs , 'item_description01' ): li_items . append ( dict ( code = code , ds = ds , qty = qty , unit = unit , price = None , amount = None )) # calculate pages: lines = len ( li_items ) max_lines_per_page = 24 pages = lines / ( max_lines_per_page - 1 ) if lines % ( max_lines_per_page - 1 ): pages = pages + 1 # fill placeholders for each page for page in range ( 1 , pages + 1 ): f . add_page () f [ 'page' ] = 'Page %s of %s ' % ( page , pages ) if pages > 1 and page < pages : s = 'Continues on page %s ' % ( page + 1 ) else : s = '' f [ 'item_description %02d ' % ( max_lines_per_page + 1 )] = s f [ \"company_name\" ] = \"Sample Company\" f [ \"company_logo\" ] = os . path . join ( request . env . web2py_path , \"gluon\" , \"contrib\" , \"pyfpdf\" , \"tutorial\" , \"logo.png\" ) f [ \"company_header1\" ] = \"Some Address - somewhere -\" f [ \"company_header2\" ] = \"http://www.example.com\" f [ \"company_footer1\" ] = \"Tax Code ...\" f [ \"company_footer2\" ] = \"Tax/VAT ID ...\" f [ 'number' ] = '0001-00001234' f [ 'issue_date' ] = '2010-09-10' f [ 'due_date' ] = '2099-09-10' f [ 'customer_name' ] = \"Sample Client\" f [ 'customer_address' ] = \"Siempreviva 1234\" # print line item... li = 0 k = 0 total = Decimal ( \"0.00\" ) for it in li_items : k = k + 1 if k > page * ( max_lines_per_page - 1 ): break if it [ 'amount' ]: total += Decimal ( \" %.6f \" % it [ 'amount' ]) if k > ( page - 1 ) * ( max_lines_per_page - 1 ): li += 1 if it [ 'qty' ] is not None : f [ 'item_quantity %02d ' % li ] = it [ 'qty' ] if it [ 'code' ] is not None : f [ 'item_code %02d ' % li ] = it [ 'code' ] if it [ 'unit' ] is not None : f [ 'item_unit %02d ' % li ] = it [ 'unit' ] f [ 'item_description %02d ' % li ] = it [ 'ds' ] if it [ 'price' ] is not None : f [ 'item_price %02d ' % li ] = \" %0.3f \" % it [ 'price' ] if it [ 'amount' ] is not None : f [ 'item_amount %02d ' % li ] = \" %0.2f \" % it [ 'amount' ] # last page? print totals: if pages == page : f [ 'net' ] = \" %0.2f \" % ( total / Decimal ( \"1.21\" )) f [ 'vat' ] = \" %0.2f \" % ( total * ( 1 - 1 / Decimal ( \"1.21\" ))) f [ 'total_label' ] = 'Total:' else : f [ 'total_label' ] = 'SubTotal:' f [ 'total' ] = \" %0.2f \" % total response . headers [ 'Content-Type' ] = 'application/pdf' return f . render ( 'invoice.pdf' ) Of course, this is a hardcoded example. You can use the database to store invoices or any other data; there is no rigid class hierachy to follow, just fill your template like a dict!","title":"Sample Templating Engine"},{"location":"overrides/index.html","text":"cf. https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/customization/#overriding-blocks","title":"Index"}]}
